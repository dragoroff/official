A Place to Stand is the remarkable tale of how he emerged after his years in the penitentiary -- much of it spent in isolation -- with the ability to read and a passion for writing poetry. A vivid portrait of life inside a maximum-security prison and an affirmation of one man's spirit in overcoming the most brutal adversity, A Place to Stand \"stands as proof there is always hope in even the most desperate lives\" -- (Fort Worth Morning Star-Telegram). \"A Place to Stand is a hell of a book, quite literally. You won't soon forget it.\" -- Luis Urrea, The San Diego Union-Tribune \"This book will have a permanent place in American letters.\" -- Jim Harrison",

            "description": "For this authoritative post-cold-war biography of Shostakovich's illustrious but turbulent career under Soviet rule, Laurel E. Fay has gone back to primary documents: Shostakovich's many letters, concert programs and reviews, newspaper articles, and diaries of his contemporaries. An indefatigable worker, he wrote his arresting music despite deprivations during the Nazi invasion and constant surveillance under Stalin's regime. Shostakovich's life is a fascinating example of the paradoxes of living as an artist under totalitarian rule. In August 1942, his Seventh Symphony, written as a protest against fascism, was performed in Nazi-besieged Leningrad by the city's surviving musicians, and was triumphantly broadcast to the German troops, who had been bombarded beforehand to silence them. Alone among his artistic peers, he survived successive Stalinist cultural purges and won the Stalin Prize five times, yet in 1948 he was dismissed from his conservatory teaching positions, and many of his works were banned from performance. He prudently censored himself, in one case putting aside a work based on Jewish folk poems. Under later regimes he balanced a career as a model Soviet, holding government positions and acting as an international ambassador with his unflagging artistic ambitions. In the years since his death in 1975, many have embraced a view of Shostakovich as a lifelong dissident who encoded anti-Communist messages in his music. This lucid and fascinating biography demonstrates that the reality was much more complex. Laurel Fay's book includes a detailed list of works, a glossary of names, and an extensive bibliography, making it an indispensable resource for future studies of Shostakovich.",

            "description": "Global governance is here--but not where most people think. This book presents the far-reaching argument that not only should we have a new world order but that we already do. Anne-Marie Slaughter asks us to completely rethink how we view the political world. It's not a collection of nation states that communicate through presidents, prime ministers, foreign ministers, and the United Nations. Nor is it a clique of NGOs. It is governance through a complex global web of \"government networks.\" Slaughter provides the most compelling and authoritative description to date of a world in which government officials--police investigators, financial regulators, even judges and legislators--exchange information and coordinate activity across national borders to tackle crime, terrorism, and the routine daily grind of international interactions. National and international judges and regulators can also work closely together to enforce international agreements more effectively than ever before. These networks, which can range from a group of constitutional judges exchanging opinions across borders to more established organizations such as the G8 or the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, make things happen--and they frequently make good things happen. But they are underappreciated and, worse, underused to address the challenges facing the world today. The modern political world, then, consists of states whose component parts are fast becoming as important as their central leadership. Slaughter not only describes these networks but also sets forth a blueprint for how they can better the world. Despite questions of democratic accountability, this new world order is not one in which some \"world government\" enforces global dictates. The governments we already have at home are our best hope for tackling the problems we face abroad, in a networked world order.",

            "description": "In this major study of a flexible and multifaceted mode of expression, Linda Hutcheon looks at works of modern literature, visual art, music, film, theater, and architecture to arrive at a comprehensive assessment of what parody is and what it does.Hutcheon identifies parody as one of the major forms of modern self-reflexivity, one that marks the intersection of invention and critique and offers an important mode of coming to terms with the texts and discourses of the past. Looking at works as diverse as Tom Stoppard's Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, Brian de Palma's Dressed to Kill, Woody Allen's Zelig, Karlheinz Stockhausen's Hymnen, James Joyce's Ulysses, and Magritte's This Is Not a Pipe, Hutcheon discusses the remarkable range of intent in modern parody while distinguishing it from pastiche, burlesque, travesty, and satire. She shows how parody, through ironic playing with multiple conventions, combines creative expression with critical commentary. Its productive-creative approach to tradition results in a modern recoding that establishes difference at the heart of similarity.In a new introduction, Hutcheon discusses why parody continues to fascinate her and why it is commonly viewed as suspect--for being either too ideologically shifty or too much of a threat to the ownership of intellectual and creative property.",

The contributors to this volume probe the nature of the case and the ways in which different understandings of the concept affect the conduct and the results of research. The contributions demonstrate that the work of any given researcher is often characterised by some hybrid of these basic approaches, and it is important to understand that most research involves multiple definitions and uses of cases, as both specific empirical phenomena and as general theoretical categories.",

A Jamaican-born author of poetry, short stories, novels, and nonfiction, McKay has often been associated with the \"New Negro\" or Harlem Renaissance, a movement of African American art, culture, and intellectualism between World War I and the Great Depression. But his relationship to the movement was complex. Literally absent from Harlem during the Renaissance, McKay devoted most of his time to traveling through Europe, Russia, and Africa during the 1920s and 1930s. His active participation in Communist groups and the radical Left also encouraged certain opinions on race and class that strained his relationship to the Harlem Renaissance and its black intelligentsia. In his 1937 autobiography, A Long Way from Home, McKay explains what it means to be a black \"rebel sojourner\" and presents one of the first unflattering, yet informative, exposés of the Harlem Renaissance. Reprinted here with a critical introduction by Gene Andrew Jarrett, this book will challenge readers to rethink McKay's articulation of identity, art, race, and politics and situate these topics in terms of his oeuvre and his literary contemporaries between the World Wars. Gene Andrew Jarrett is an assistant professor of English at the University of Maryland, College Park, and the author of Deans and Truants: Race and Realism in African American Literature.",

It begins by presenting the analytic framework for reasoning about informed consent found in moral philosophy and law. The authors then review and interpret the history of informed consent in clinical medicine, research, and the courts. They argue that respect for autonomy has had a central role in the justification and function of informed consent requirements. Then they present a theory of the nature of informed consent that is based on an appreciation of its historical roots. An important contribution to a topic of current legal and ethical debate, this study is accessible to everyone with a serious interest in biomedical ethics, including physicians, philosophers, policy makers, religious ethicists, lawyers, and psychologists.

Hsia examines the major writers from Lu Hsun to Eileen Chang and selected works of representative importance since 1949 from both mainland China and Taiwan. Professor David T. Roy hailed the book in the Christian Science Monitor when it was first published, and his comments are as relevant today as they were then: \"The publication of C. T. Hsia's book is an event of the first importance. It has the distinction of being the first serious study of modern Chinese fiction in English. It also has the rarer distinction of being the best study of its subject available in any language. No more ambitious attempt to apply the principles of modern Western literary criticism to the study of Chinese literature has ever been made. Not only the specialist, but every reader who is interested in China or in literature will find it of interest...\"",

            "description": "When Joseph Nathaniel Beckles registered for the draft in the 1942, he rejected the racial categories presented to him and persuaded the registrar to cross out the check mark she had placed next to Negro and substitute “Ethiopian Hebrew.” “God did not make us Negroes,” declared religious leaders in black communities of the early twentieth-century urban North. They insisted that so-called Negroes are, in reality, Ethiopian Hebrews, Asiatic Muslims, or raceless children of God. Rejecting conventional American racial classification, many black southern migrants and immigrants from the Caribbean embraced these alternative visions of black history, racial identity, and collective future, thereby reshaping the black religious and racial landscape. Focusing on the Moorish Science Temple, the Nation of Islam, Father Divine’s Peace Mission Movement, and a number of congregations of Ethiopian Hebrews, Judith Weisenfeld argues that the appeal of these groups lay not only in the new religious opportunities membership provided, but also in the novel ways they formulated a religio-racial identity. Arguing that members of these groups understood their religious and racial identities as divinely-ordained and inseparable, the book examines how this sense of self shaped their conceptions of their bodies, families, religious and social communities, space and place, and political sensibilities. Weisenfeld draws on extensive archival research and incorporates a rich array of sources to highlight the experiences of average members. The book demonstrates that the efforts by members of these movements to contest conventional racial categorization contributed to broader discussions in black America about the nature of racial identity and the collective future of black people that still resonate today.",

            "description": "Given the centrality of Africa to Italy's national identity, a thorough study of Italian colonial history and culture has been long overdue. Two important developments, the growth of postcolonial studies and the controversy surrounding immigration from Africa to the Italian peninsula, have made it clear that the discussion of Italy's colonial past is essential to any understanding of the history and construction of the nation. This collection, the first to gather articles by the most-respected scholars in Italian colonial studies, highlights the ways in which colonial discourse has pervaded Italian culture from the post-unification period to the present. During the Risorgimento, Africa was invoked as a limb of a proudly resuscitated Imperial Rome. During the Fascist era, imperialistic politics were crucial in shaping both domestic and international perceptions of the Italian nation. These contributors offer compelling essays on decolonization, exoticism, fascist and liberal politics, anthropology, and historiography, not to mention popular literature, feminist studies, cinema, and children's literature. Because the Italian colonial past has had huge repercussions, not only in Italy and in the former colonies but also in other countries not directly involved, scholars in many areas will welcome this broad and insightful panorama of Italian colonial culture.",

The author provides a review of the significant features of the metallurgy and application of titanium and its alloys. All technical aspects of the use of titanium are covered, with sufficient metals property data for most users. Because of its unique density, corrosion resistance, and relative strength advantages over competing materials such as aluminum, steels, and superalloys, titanium has found a niche in many industries. Much of this use has occurred through military research, and subsequent applications in aircraft, of gas turbine engines, although more recent use features replacement joints, golf clubs, and bicycles.Contents include: A primer on titanium and its alloys, Introduction to selection of titanium alloys, Understanding titanium's metallurgy and mill products, Forging and forming, Castings, Powder metallurgy, Heat treating, Joining technology and practice, Machining, Cleaning and finishing, Structure/processing/property relationships, Corrosion resistance, Advanced alloys and future directions, Appendices: Summary table of titanium alloys, Titanium alloy datasheets, Cross-reference to titanium alloys, Listing of selected specification and standardization organizations, Selected manufacturers, suppliers, services, Corrosion data, Machining data.",

            "description": "John Stachel, the author of this collection of 37 published and unpublished articles on Albert Einstein, has written about Einstein and his work for over 40 years. Trained as a theoretical physicist specializing in the theory of relativity, he was chosen as the founding editor of The Collected papers of Albert Einstein 25 years ago, and is currently Director of the Boston University Center for Einstein Studies. Based on a detailed study of documentary evidence, much of which was newly discovered in the course of his work, Stachel debunks many of the old (and some new) myths about Einstein and offers novel insight into his life and work. Throughout the volume, a new, more human picture of Einstein is offered to replace the plaster saint of popular legend. In particular, a youthful Einstein emerges from the obscurity that previously shrouded his early years, and much new light is shed on the origins of the special and general theories of relativity. Also discussed in some detail are Einstein's troubled relationship with his first wife, his friendships with other physicists such as Eddington, Bose, and Pauli, and his Jewish identity. The essays are grouped thematically into the following areas: * The Human Side * Editing the Einstein Papers * Surveys of Einstein's Work * Special Relativity * General Relativity * Quantum Theory * Einstein and Other Scientists * Book Reviews Because the essays are independent of one another, readers will be able to dip into this collection to satisfy varying interests. It will be of particular interest to historians of 20th century science, working physicists, and students, as well as to the many members of the general reading public who continue to be fascinated by aspects of Einstein's life and work.",

Rosen (1922-1999) received his philological and linguistic training in Europe and Israel, and taught in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and, on various occasions, in France, Germany and the United States. He has published extensively in the field of Indo-European and Semitic Linguistics (cf. the three volumes of East and West. Selected Writings in Linguistics), and has made a pioneering contribution to the description of contemporary Hebrew. His editions and linguistic studies of Herodotus and Homer are basic reference tools for classical scholars. A first-rate connoisseur of the history of linguistics, especially of pre-structuralist and structuralist linguistics, Prof. H.B. Rosen was one of the founders, with H.-J. Polotsky, of the Jerusalem school of structuralist-functionalist linguistics. The book contains a detailed bio-bibliographical survey of H.B. Rosen's life and work; the survey is followed by Prof. Rosen's hitherto unpublished text (edited by Hannah Rosen) \"The Jerusalem Scool of Linguistics and the Prague School\".",

It was originally known as \"serum hepatitis\" and has caused current epidemics in parts of Asia and Africa. Hepatitis B is recognised as endemic in China and various other parts of Asia. The proportion of the world's population currently infected with the virus is 3 to 6%, but up to a third have been exposed. Symptoms of the acute illness caused by the virus include liver inflammation, vomiting, jaundice, and rarely, death. Chronic hepatitis B may cause liver cirrhosis which may then lead to liver cancer.

This book reviews what is known about b-quark decays and also looks at what can be learned in the future.The importance of this research area is increasing, as evidenced by the approval of the luminosity upgrade for CESR and the asymmetric B factories at SLAC and KEK, and the possibility of experiments at hadron colliders.The key experimental observations made thus far, measurement of the lifetimes of the different B species, B0-B0 mixing, the discovery of ?Penguin? mediated decays, and the extraction of the CKM matrix elements Vub and Vcb from semileptonic decays, as well as more mundane results, are described in great detail by the experimentalists who have been closely involved with making the measurements. Theoretical progress in understanding b-quark decays using HQET and lattice gauge techniques are described by theorists who have developed and used these techniques.Synthesizing the experimental and theoretical information, several articles discuss the implications for the ?Standard Model? and how further tests can be done using measurements of CP violation in the B system.",

To understand how B cells are normally prevented from reacting to self-tissue, what goes wrong in autoimmunity, and how B cells contribute to it is the aim of this book. This volume includes more than a dozen in-depth reviews by researchers specializing in various aspects of basic B cell biology that have relevance to autoimmune diseases. These up-to-date chapters present the latest information on B cell signal transduction, apoptosis, genetics and molecular biology. Also featured are chapters with special reference to particular autoimmune diseases in which B cells have been shown to play a critical role, such as type 1 diabetes, chronic graft-versus-host disease and lupus erythematosus. Further topics covered include the role of the complement system, rheumatoid factors, and anti-DNA autoantibodies as well as important related areas such as natural autoantibodies, B cell immune tolerance, Toll receptor signaling, and the immunobiology of BAFF/BLyS. Both basic researchers and clinician scientists who wish to understand the role of B lymphocytes in immune tolerance and autoimmunity will benefit from this timely publication.",

Other chapters focus on topics such as membrane-associated proteins with important functional roles during B cell activation and differentiation; thymus-independent and thymus-dependent activation; mechanisms operative during B-T cell interactions, including the role of B cells as antigen-presenting cells; and the importance of soluble mediators. Additional topics include the regulatory role of T cells during B cell repertoire expression, memory development, tolerance, and autoimmunity. T-Cell Dependent and Independent B-Cell Activation is an important history and reference resource for humoral immune response investigators, as well as advanced graduate and medical students.",

The subject matter for this symposium represents an attractive spectrum of medical, biological and molecular approaches to the practical solution of a public health prob1em--name1y, prevention of infection with the hepatitis B virus. The symposium may be unique in that it focuses on a product which was first marketed less than three months ago, but included in the program are presen tations on two new approaches to hepatitis B vaccine production which may replace the one which is newly unveiled.

Presenting results of research work on the definition of B cell subset populations, this book explains the basic mechanisms that control B cell activation, stimulation and regulation. Articles include studies on both normal and malignant B cells and describe the mechanisms underlying T-B cell interactions during the immune response. The most important advances in the field of immunodeficiency are also reported.

C is also a widely accepted programming language in the software industries. This beginner’s guide to computer programming is for student programmers to effectively write programs for solving numerical problems. All that is required of a beginner programmer is not experience in computing but interest in computing. The programs illustrated in the book have been accumulated, experimented and tested by the author during his teaching of the subject to a few thousand students in over a decade. In addition, numerous problems are adapted form university question papers. Short questions and answers and objective questions are an added feature. All these would build confidence of the students and those appearing for interview/viva voce in a practical lab. The special topic of the book is C graphics and animation which helps students develop simple programs to generate geometrical and graphical objects.",

The version of C used is the one standardised by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI C). C has rapidly gained users due to its efficiency, rich data structure, variety of operators and affinity to UNIX operating system. C is a difficult language to learn if it is not methodically approached. Our attempt has been to introduce the basic aspects of C to enable the student to quickly start writing C programs and postpone more difficult features of C to later chapters. The methodology of presentation closely follows the one used by the author in his popular book on PASCAL programming. Those who know PASCAL will find it very easy to learn C using this book.",

Style and debugging also play a tremendous part in creating programs that run well and are easy to maintain. This book teaches you not only the mechanics of programming, but also describes how to create programs that are easy to read, debug, and update.Practical rules are stressed. For example, there are fifteen precedence rules in C (&& comes before || comes before ?:). The practical programmer reduces these to two: Multiplication and division come before addition and subtraction. Contrary to popular belief, most programmers do not spend most of their time creating code. Most of their time is spent modifying someone else's code. This books shows you how to avoid the all-too-common obfuscated uses of C (and also to recognize these uses when you encounter them in existing programs) and thereby to leave code that the programmer responsible for maintenance does not have to struggle with. Electronic Archaeology, the art of going through someone else's code, is described.This third edition introduces popular Integrated Development Environments on Windows systems, as well as UNIX programming utilities, and features a large statistics-generating program to pull together the concepts and features in the language.",

A new \"Sources\" chapter points to supplemental literature for readers needing more information on any topic. A novel aspect is the inclusion of working C code for many of the algorithms, with discussion of practical implementation issues. The self-contained treatment presumes only an elementary knowledge of mathematics, but reaches topics on the frontier of current research, making it a useful reference for practitioners at all levels. The code in this new edition is significantly improved from the first edition, and four new routines are included. Java versions for this new edition are also available.

Hilbert $C*$-modules provide a natural generalization of Hilbert spaces arising when the field of scalars $\\mathbf{C $ is replaced by an arbitrary $C*$-algebra. The general theory of Hilbert $C*$-modules appeared more than 30 years ago in the pioneering papers of W. Paschke and M. Rieffel and has proved to be a powerful tool inoperator algebras theory, index theory of elliptic operators, $K$- and $KK$-theory, and in noncommutative geometry as a whole. Alongside these applications, the theory of Hilbert $C*$-modules is interesting on its own. In this book, the authors explain in detail the basic notions and results of thetheory, and provide a number of important examples. Some results related to the authors' research interests are also included. A large part of the book is devoted to structural results (self-duality, reflexivity) and to nonadjointable operators. Most of the book can be read with only a basic knowledge of functional analysis; however, some experience in the theory of operator algebras makes reading easier.",

Information on how to obtain, grow, and maintain C. elegans for use as a model system is given in Chapter 4. Chapters 2 and 3 describe the genome project and show how to use genome sequence information by searching the database for homologues using different search methods and then how to analyse the search data. The next chapter gives the essential practical details of transformation and common uses for the technique. Chapter 6 covers reverse genetics and describes strategies for gene inactivation that are known to work in C elegans: epigenetic inactivation and mutational germ line inactivation. Chapter 7 is designed to help the user analyse phenotype by microscopy and includes Normaski, fluorescence, 4-dimensional, and electron microscopy. Techniques for studying the neurobiology of C. elegans are given in chapter 8. Chapter 9 describes the three commonly used approaches for studying gene expression and Chapter 10 deals with the common methods of molecular biology essential for gene characterization. C. elegans is not the ideal organism for biochemical studies, but chapter 11 describes several procedures for producing biochemically useful quantities of pure tissues. The final chapter is about conventional genetics and details the standard procedures for selfing and crossing; mutagenesis and mutant screening; characterization of mutants; gene mapping; temperature-shift experiments and mosaic analysis. Caenorhabditis Elegans: A Practical Approach will therefore provide all the background information necessary for use of C. elegans as a model system.",

However, many colleges and universities continue to believe that learning a programming language is an indispensable part of a science and engineering education. C and its derivatives are now the most widely taught programming languages, and they play an essential role in scientific and engineering computing. The problem-solving skills required to write programs in C are important for mastering other technical computing tools and, as the need arises, for learning other languages. This text presents the essentials of the C language, concentrating on what engineering and science students need to know to solve typical computational problems. It uses a learn-by-doing approach, with many examples of complete programs and exercises drawn from science and engineering disciplines. The text is written for undergraduate and graduate students who have had no previous formal introduction to a programming language. However, the text does assume that students are familiar with basic computer hardware, terminology, and applications.",

            "description": "Centuries ago, during the industrial revolution, rickets, also called 'the English disease', spread rapidly among city-dwelling poor children and became endemic due to vitamin D deficiency and insufficient access to sunlight. Nowadays it appears to be endemic again as the increase of vitamin D deficiency is paralleling the primacy of breast-feeding in Western societies. Breastfeeding, nutritional status and dark skin are the main risk factors for rickets or 'rachitis' as is the correct medical term. Rickets is a childhood disorder and the basis for understanding the disease is rooted in the concept of mineral metabolism and its control mechanisms in the growing fetus, infant and child. As it is now understood that rickets is not only caused by vitamin D deficiency, it has to be kept in mind that vitamin D and calcium deficiency is prevalent in developing countries as well as in affluent societies, where children and their mothers are not exposed to as much sunlight as they need. The rapid growth in molecular biology has been exemplified in the application of subcellular technologies to study vitamin D in human and animal models. In this volume the latest research on vitamin D and rickets is presented from different perspectives such as the interesting historical overview to bone metabolism, molecular genetics of vitamin D and conclusions for disease prevention. It will be of special interest to pediatricians, endocrinologists and health care specialists who work with children at risk for the disease.",

While it is argued that he lacked a grand scheme or single plan to transform the role of the national government, the incremental measures adopted during the New Deal changed the federal government's role to a degree unmatched in American history. This anthology is composed of ten chapters, seven of which examine the reactions of particular groups within Congress and beyond (including those of individual congressmen), and three of which examine facets of the New Deal era from a contemporary perspective. Together these chapters consitute a fresh take on a key period in modern American politics and a central figure in our history. In addition the book provides an appendix of congressional mavericks, and a substantial glossary of the many individuals mentioned in the text.",

            "description": "Gabriele D'Annunzio, 'Gabriel of the Annunciation', shocked and dazzled early twentieth-century Europe with his sexual exploits, military feats, and political escapades. In a blaze of self-publicity those activities provided material for his fiery journalism and the stunning literary creations which have influenced each succeeding generation of Italian writers. French translations of his scandalous novels first exposed Europe to his genius, but his roots lay deep in his native soil. A pivotal presence in the evolution of Italian literature, politics, society, and taste, he rarely allowed his name to fall from the public gaze during forty critical years, and more than any other Italian since the unification of his country, he casts a shadow forwards to the present day. D'Annunzio's sexual promiscuity was legendary, yet he was a somewhat unconventional Casanova: something under five foot six, prematurely balding, blinded in one eye during the war, and blessed with what his secretary-factotum called unfortunate teeth, he was the caricaturist's dream. At the age of sixteen he pawned his grandfather's watch for the money to visit a brothel. And though he was married for 55 years to Maris, Duchess of Gallese, his adult years witnessed a trail of discarded lovers, who were severally driven to drugs, suicide attempts, alcoholism, and madness. His countless liaisons involved a number of women cast as muses in his writings, including artistes such as Eleonora Duse, Ida Rubinstein, and Isadora Duncan. From his earliest years D'Annunzio set out to create a unique personality for himself, aided by friends who invented myths about his life and early writings. In adolescence he circulated rumours of his own death to the Italian newspapers, helping to stir up interest in the imminent publication of his latest work. That slim volume, mentioned in most of the ensuing obituaries, sold well and found sympathetic reviewers. As time passed, other stories accumulated and attached themselves to his public persona, until truth and fiction became indistinguishable. Had he been born during a storm at sea on the deck of the sailing-ship Irene? Was he involved in the celebrated theft of the Mona Lisa in 1911? Had he experimented with cannibalism during a journey through Libya? Was he, in the end, assassinated by a Nazi spy for his opposition in 1937 to the alliance between Mussolini and Hitler? The present biography is the first fully-documented appraisal of this extraordinary man's career, making use of previously unpublished manuscripts and new source material, and attempting to maintain a degree of objectivity never previously seen in Dannunzian scholarship.",

But more than this, the book is a study of the relations between science and philosophy during the Enlightenment, as reflected in the life and work of Jean d'Alembert, one of that period's most prominent spokesmen. By showing the interactions of one \"philosophe\" with the scientific, social and philosophical communities of the eighteenth century, Professor Hankins reveals how Enlightenment philosophy borrowed heavily from the methods and goals of science.",

The co-ordinating theme of this study is that Hardy designed Tess of the d’Urbervilles to be controversial, and it has surpassed his design. An initial biographical chapter relates Tess to Hardy’s career: the novel caused scandal but brought him wealth. Next, the work’s process of composition is discussed, and differences between the censored serial and the book versions are explained. An analysis of the plot gives particular attention to its ironic strategies, and a further section deals with problematic aspects of characterisation, including the views of the narrator. Various themes and contexts are explored, notably Hardy’s attitudes to religion, evolution, politics and sexuality. There follows a discussion of selected literary aspects: naturalism and realism, leitmotifs and thematic patterns, optical effects and defamiliarisation, and the use of specialised vocabularies. Hardy’s descriptive powers when rendering the rural world receive particular analysis. A critical survey then summarises critical approaches to this novel between Hardy’s day and the present.",

Yet, for many-from experienced scientists to trainees-it represents a (rather too) sophisticated process whose true insight is excessively demanding. However, when not simplyconsidered as a private ground for a few aficionados, it can be seen as a way of understanding how maturelympho cytes carry on their basic functions. For the group of aficionados-which includes this editor-it is an elegant paradigm featuring many fascinating evolutionary achievements of which the biological world alone has the secret. These include a subtle biochemical principle most likelyhijacked some 470 million years ago from an ancestral gene invader and since then cleverly adapted by jawed vertebrates to precisely cleave and rearrange their antigen receptor (Ig andTCR)loci. This invader would itself have assigned the services of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNArepair machinery as well as various DNApolymerases or transferases to work in concert with developmental clues in lymphoid cell lineages to generate an immune repertoire and efficient host surveillance while avoiding autoimmunity. Recently, important new refinements in these systems have emerged, continuing to challenge ourknowledge andbeliefs. These arejust thetopics covered by the senior authors-all established leaders in this field-and their colleagues, whilst writing the various chapters in V(D)J Recombination.",

Four of the 35-person crew escaped to a small raft, to which they clung in total darkness, braving 30-foot waves and frigid temperatures. As the storm raged on, a search-and-rescue mission hunted for survivors, while the frantic citizens of nearby Rogers City, Michigan, the hardscrabble town that was home to 26 members of the Carl D. Bradley's crew, anxiously awaited word of their loved ones' fates. In Wreck of the Carl D., Michael Schumacher reconstructs the terrible accident, perilous search, and chilling aftermath for the small Michigan town so intimately affected by the tragedy.",

This important global trend works together with a growing integration in corporate business processes, and a convergence in network architecture as e-payment of all kinds moves to Internet protocol systems. The net result is a new e-payment landscape that presents daunting challenges on many levels, as well as exciting opportunities, for banks, businesses and governments. Consumer and citizen interests are also at stake. This book takes a unique, wholly integrated look at the e-payment landscape, understanding the way that existing systems are being stretched and challenged. Credit card systems are extended to facilitate Internet-based eCommerce. Consumers are becoming accustomed to using their stored-value mass transit cards to make payments for goods and services. Corporations put pressure on banks to integrate business information into their electronic payment processes. New non-financial players emerge holding important floats and many of these players are challenging for key parts of the banking franchise. This bo",

For most people it's a shorthand way of deciding how highly the market regards a company, with investors prepared to overpay for earnings from a high-P/E 'glamour' stock as opposed to a low-P/E 'value' stock. However, academics have known since 1960 that the opposite is true: value stocks outperform glamour stocks consistently over decades. A company with a low P/E may have been marked down for no readily apparent reason and thus could represent an attractive value investment for those with the patience to wait while the market re-values it. However, the P/E is a backward-looking measure and just because the company earned 1 per share last year it doesn't necessarily mean it will earn anything like that in the foreseeable future. Or, a low P/E can mean a company is deservedly cheap because it is in financial difficulty - in this case the company is likely to become cheaper yet or even go into administration. This book is a practical guide to how you can adjust and improve the price-earnings ratio and use it, alongside other financial ratios, to run against the crowd and boost your stock returns.\"",

They focus on three key areas: the customer-technology interface; e-Service business opportunities and strategies; and public sector e-Service opportunities.

But that did not happen, and also the dot-com soap bubble burst. This suggests that there is much yet to be learned about innovation in public administration, especially about innovations at the cornerstones of technological and institutional transformations. New and more fully developed formulations of theory into practice are needed. The goal of the editors of this book is to contribute to some aspects of the understanding of e-government. In order to understand electronic government, one has to scrutinize the various environments and contexts in which e-government is developed and implemented. As such, it builds upon the biological and environmental lines of reasoning that have been suggested by authors like Bonnie Nardi and Vicky O'Day, and Thomas Davenport and Laurence Prusak.",

Thus, e-health refers to a fundamental redesign of healthcare processes based on the use and integration of electronic communication at all levels. It aims to lead to patient empowerment which describes the transition from a passive role where the patient is the recipient of care services to an active role where the patient is informed, has choices and is involved in the decision making process. e-Health has the potential to improve efficiency on a global level when patients cross national boundaries to seek treatment in other countries and to enable medical facilities and services across countries to be linked and accessible to citizens. Discussion topics focus on the use of mobile technologies in health care, \"smart home\" technologies, telemedicine applications that cross national borders, transatlantic collaborations in bioinformatics and the use of the Internet in health care. Furthermore, legislative efforts and ethical concerns associated with the diffusion of e-health are discussed and policies in the EU and the US reviewed and compared.",

Just allow authorized people to transact business securely and efficiently through the Internet, and keep unauthorized people away from valuable information. But in today's impersonal and global economy, how can a business or organization really know who they are really allowing into their systems? And how can they be sure unauthorized people are always kept out? In a highly interconnected and transaction-driven world, deciding who should be kept out or included is becoming more difficult every day. Due in part to interdependent global economic conditions, international terrorism concerns and human ingenuity involved with misusing technology for ill gotten gains, e-commerce security is neither simple nor static.",

In the funniest, clearest study to date, Benjamin Bergen explains why, and what that tells us about our language and brains. Nearly everyone swears-whether it's over a few too many drinks, in reaction to a stubbed toe, or in flagrante delicto. And yet, we sit idly by as words are banned from television and censored in books. We insist that people excise profanity from their vocabularies and we punish children for yelling the very same dirty words that we'll mutter in relief seconds after they fall asleep. Swearing, it seems, is an intimate part of us that we have decided to selectively deny. That's a damn shame. Swearing is useful. It can be funny, cathartic, or emotionally arousing. As linguist and cognitive scientist Benjamin K. Bergen shows us, it also opens a new window onto how our brains process language and why languages vary around the world and over time. In this groundbreaking yet ebullient romp through the linguistic muck, Bergen answers intriguing questions: How can patients left otherwise speechless after a stroke still shout Goddamn! when they get upset? When did a cock grow to be more than merely a rooster? Why is crap vulgar when poo is just childish? Do slurs make you treat people differently? Why is the first word that Samoan children say not mommy but eat shit? And why do we extend a middle finger to flip someone the bird? Smart as hell and funny as fuck, What the F is mandatory reading for anyone who wants to know how and why we swear.",

His travels lead him from his home in New York City to a drinking bender across Ireland, through the glitz and glamour that is Las Vegas, and to the hedonistic pleasure palaces of Thailand. After a lifetime of playing it safe, Mr. Sullivan finally follows his heart and lives out everyone's deepest fantasies. For who among us hasn't dreamed of standing stark naked, head upturned, and mouth agape beneath a cascading torrent of Guinness Stout? What could be more exhilarating than losing every penny you have because Charlie Weiss went for a meaningless last-second field goal? And what sensate creature could ever doubt that the greatest pleasure known to man can be found in a leaky bamboo shack filled with glassy-eyed, bruised Asian hookers? Bob Sullivan has a lot to teach us about life. Let's just pray we have the wisdom to put aside our preconceptions and listen. Because what Bob Sullivan finds isn't at all what he expected.",

This collection of essays presents fresh insights into his writing, discussing neglected texts and approaching familiar works from new perspectives. Seventeen scholarly articles deal not only with Fitzgerald's novels but with his stories and essays as well, considering such topics as the Roman Catholic background of The Beautiful and Damned and the influence of Mark Twain on Fitzgerald's work and self-conception. The volume also features four personal essays by Fitzgerald's friends Budd Schulberg, Frances Kroll Ring, publisher Charles Scribner III, and writer George Garrett that shed new light on his personal and professional lives. Together these contributions demonstrate the continued vitality of Fitzgerald's work and establish new directions for ongoing discussions of his life and writing.",

Later, NASA ran the development of this F-1 engine in order to use it to power the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that would send Apollo missions to the Moon.

            "description": "We all know what frak, popularized by television's cult hit Battlestar Galactica, really means. But what about feck? Or ferkin? Or foul--as in FUBAR, or \"Fouled Up Beyond All Recognition\"? In a thoroughly updated edition of The F-Word, Jesse Sheidlower offers a rich, revealing look at the f-bomb and its illimitable uses. Since the fifteenth century, no other word has been adapted, interpreted, euphemized, censored, and shouted with as much ardor or force; imagine Dick Cheney telling Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy to \"go damn himself\" on the Senate floor--it doesn't have quite the same impact as what was really said. Sheidlower cites this and other notorious examples throughout history, from the satiric sixteenth-century poetry of James Cranstoun to the bawdy parodies of Lord Rochester in the seventeenth century, to more recent uses by Ernest Hemingway, Jack Kerouac, Ann Sexton, Norman Mailer, Liz Phair, Anthony Bourdain, Junot Diaz, Jenna Jameson, Amy Winehouse, Jon Stewart, and Bono (whose use of the word at the Grammys nearly got him fined by the FCC). Collectively, these references and the more than one hundred new entries they illustrate double the size of The F-Word since its previous edition. Thousands of added quotations come from newly available electronic databases and the resources of the OED, expanding the range of quotations to cover British, Canadian, Australian, New Zealand, Irish, and South African uses in addition to American ones. Thus we learn why a fugly must hone his or her sense of humor, why Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau muttered \"fuddle duddle\" in the Commons, and why Fanny Adams is so sweet. A fascinating introductory essay explores the word's history, reputation, and changing popularity over time. and a new Foreword by comedian, actor, and author Lewis Black offers readers a smart and entertaining take on the book and its subject matter. Oxford dictionaries have won renown for their expansive, historical approach to words and their etymologies. The F-Word offers all that and more in an entertaining and informative look at a word that, while now largely accepted as an integral part of the English language, still confounds, provokes, and scandalizes.",

Scott Fitzgerald as a writer and as a public and private figure. No aspect of his career is overlooked, from his first novel published in 1920, through his more than 170 short stories, to his last unfinished Hollywood novel. Contributions present the reader with a full and accessible picture of the background of American social and cultural change in the early decades of the twentieth century. The introduction traces Fitzgerald's career as a literary and public figure, and examines the extent to which public recognition has affected his reputation among scholars, critics, and general readers over the past sixty years. This volume offers undergraduates, graduates and general readers a full account of Fitzgerald's work as well as suggestions for further exploration of his work.",

Scott Fitzgerald remains one of the most recognizable literary figures of the twentieth century, his legendary life - including his tempestuous romance with his wife and muse Zelda - continues to overshadow his art. However glamorous his image as the poet laureate of the 1920s, he was first and foremost a great writer with a gift for fluid, elegant prose. This introduction reminds readers why Fitzgerald deserves his preeminent place in literary history. It discusses not only his best-known works, The Great Gatsby (1925) and Tender Is the Night (1934), but the full scope of his output, including his other novels and his short stories. This book introduces new readers and students of Fitzgerald to his trademark themes, his memorable characters, his significant plots, the literary modes and genres from which he borrowed, and his inimitable style.",

Editors Matthew J. Bruccoli, the foremost Fitzgerald scholar, and Judith S. Baughman have collected the most usable and articulate pieces on Fitzgerald, including a three-part 1922 interview conducted for the St. Paul Daily News. Fitzgerald (1896-1940) died before the authorial interview became a literary subgenre after World War II. Although Fitzgerald enjoyed his celebrity, as is clear in these pieces, he had a poor sense of public relations and provided interviewers with opportunities to trivialize him. As a result, Fitzgerald was often treated condescendingly in the press. Seven of his interviews-five printed before 1924-have flapper in their headlines. In the Jazz Age-a term Fitzgerald coined-he was regarded as a spokesman for rebellious youth, as a playboy, as an authority on sex and marriage, as an expert on Prohibition, and as an immensely popular writer for his work published in the Saturday Evening Post. Yet his literary ambitions were sizable and his impact on American fiction immeasurable. Matthew J. Bruccoli is Jefferies Professor of English at the University of South Carolina. He has written or edited thirty volumes on Fitzgerald, including the standard biography, Some Sort of Epic Grandeur: The Life of F. Scott Fitzgerald. Judith S. Baughman, who works in the department of English at the University of South Carolina, has written the F. Scott Fitzgerald volume in the Gale Study Guides series and has edited American Decades: 1920-1929.",

G. Thomas Tanselle argues, on the contrary, that the two activities cannot be separated. The textual critic, in choosing among textual variants and correcting what appear to be textual errors, inevitably exercises critical judgment and reflects a particular point of view toward the nature of literature. And the literary critic, in interpreting the meaning of a work or passage, needs to be (though rarely is) critical of the makeup of every text of it, including those produced by scholarly editors.",

They also present new findings about how GPCR dimerization/oligomerization modifies the properties of individual receptors and show how recent developments are leading to significant advances in drug discovery, such as the detection of ligands for orphan GPCRs. Also discussed are the most recent developments that could lead to new drug discoveries: the role of GPCRs in mediating pain, the development of receptor-type selective drugs based on the structural plasticity of receptor activation, and the identification of natural ligands of orphan GPCRs (deorphanization) as possible drug targets.",

The main object is the study of G-series, that is, power series y=aij=0 Ajxj with coefficients in an algebraic number field K. These series satisfy a linear differential equation Ly=0 with LIK(x) [d/dx] and have non-zero radii of convergence for each imbedding of K into the complex numbers. They have the further property that the common denominators of the first s coefficients go to infinity geometrically with the index s. After presenting a review of valuation theory and elementary p-adic analysis together with an application to the congruence zeta function, this book offers a detailed study of the p-adic properties of formal power series solutions of linear differential equations. In particular, the p-adic radii of convergence and the p-adic growth of coefficients are studied. Recent work of Christol, Bombieri, André, and Dwork is treated and augmented. The book concludes with Chudnovsky's theorem: the analytic continuation of a G -series is again a G -series. This book will be indispensable for those wishing to study the work of Bombieri and André on global relations and for the study of the arithmetic properties of solutions of ordinary differential equations.",

Lynch The past decade has seen tremendous advances in the study of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the molecular cloning and identification of more than 100 GPCR genes. But while GPCRs serve as targets for more than 300 medicines in the modern pharmacopoeia, the shrinking pool of known ligands and the continuing discovery of orphan GPCR genes have underscored the need for new approaches to ligand identification. Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors addresses this new direction in GPCR biochemistry-offering a definitive laboratory bench manual that emphasizes expression over primary cloning strategies. In a series of expert contributions by well-known researchers, this book provides detailed protocols for various expression systems-from bacteria to mammalian cells-as well as straightforward opinions on the advantages and shortcomings of each approach. Topics covered include: * Homology screening and the polymerase chain reaction in the cloning of GPCR genes * Cloning of GPCRs using mammalian cell expression * GPCR informatics and the orphan problem * The use of Xenopus laevis oocytes for the study of GPCRs * Stable expression of GPCRs in mammalian cells * Heterologous expression in primary cell cultures * Expression of GPCRs in Escherichia coli * Large scale expression and purification of GPCRs in mammalian cells * High-level expression of GPCRs in the Baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system * Expression of GPCRs in Drosophila Schneider 2 cells * Methods for genetic analysis and ligand identification using heterologous GPCRs expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Supplemented with numerous photographs and illustrations, Identification and Expression of G Protein-Coupled Receptors is important reading for biochemists, pharmacologists, neuroscientists, structural biologists, and anyone involved in GPCR-based research. It delivers a wealth of useful advice, practical tips, and invaluable insight into trends at the cutting-edge of current research.

The present book is focused on the emerging evidence for interactions of G protein-coupled receptors with scaffolding, cytoskeletal and signalling proteins that will play a role in the targeting, anchoring and functioning of these receptors in the plasma membrane, thus contributing to cell development and plasticity.",

Growing up in a family where everyone came together at the dinner table, Elizabeth Hasselbeck savored the signature meatball, lasagna, and ziti dishes of her grandmother and great-grandmother, and the pierogies of her father’s heritage. But a decade ago, the Emmy Award–winning co-host of The View, New York Times bestselling author, and mother of three was diagnosed with celiac disease, and the family recipes she grew up with suddenly became strictly off-limits.

            "description": "G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are membrane proteins that transduce a vast array of extracellular signals into intracellular reactions ranging from cell-cell communication processes to physiological responses. They play an important role in a variety of diseases from cancer and diabetes, to neurodegenerative, inflammatory and respiratory disorders. GPCRs are therefore of utmost interest in drug development: over half of all prescription drugs currently on the market act by targeting these receptors directly or indirectly. G Protein-coupled Receptors: Molecular Pharmacology provides a clear summary of the current knowledge in this fast-evolving field. The book sets out with an introduction to signalling molecules and their receptors, and an overview of the technical approaches used to investigate these interactions. Structural, functional and especially pharmacological aspects of GPCRs are then discussed in more detail and much attention is devoted to the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. The now widespread use of recombinant cell lies, receptor mutants and related artifices in drug research is critically evaluated. Special attention is also devoted to topical but often poorly understood concepts, such as insurmountable antagonism, inverse agonism and allosteric interactions. By combining general information with the major state-of-the-art concepts in GPCR-research, this outstanding book equips the reader with the necessary background for understanding and critically evaluating the current literature. Written by two experts from academia and industry, G Protein-coupled Receptors: Molecular Pharmacology offers a unique view of academic and applied approaches aiming to reveal new ideas in pharmaceutical research. The book is of interest to anyone involved in drug development and preclinical research and those who need to function within multi-disciplinary teams in the pharmaceutical industry: from investigators to product managers or clinicians who seek to have a broad mechanistic understanding of drug-receptor interactions. It is also an invaluable resource for final year undergraduate and postgraduate students in pharmacology and cell and molecular biology.",

            "description": "Performing in a high G environment is extremely demanding on the body: pulling G forces blood to the body’s extremities, putting the pilot, astronaut or driver at risk of G-Induced Lack of Consciousness (G-LOC). In “Pulling G” Erik Seedhouse describes what it feels like to pull 7 G in a fighter plane and the G pressures on the body when driving a Formula 1 car and many other gravity-defying vehicles. The book relates, for the first time, the effects of G in both hyper-gravity and microgravity. It describes the human response to increased and decreased G and the potentially dangerous effects of high G, with particular reference to dynamic injuries sustained in high acceleration environments. “Pulling G” provides an overview of G-related research and the development of intervention methods to mitigate the effects of increased and reduced G. As well as relating the training required to overcome G-forces on the Formula 1 track, Erik Seedhouse looks at the G forces encountered in such G environments as ejection from an aircraft, launch/re-entry, and zero-G. The book also considers how artificial gravity can be used to prevent bone demineralization and to reduce the effects of de-conditioning in astronauts. Erik Seedhouse is eminently qualified to describe the effects of large accelerations on the body. In addition to being the author of several previously published Springer Praxis books, he has developed astronaut-training protocols and is the training director for Astronauts for Hire (A4H). He is also the Canadian Forces’ High Risk Acceleration Training Officer.",

During the last five decades, Yang-Mills theory, which is undeniably the most important cornerstone of theoretical physics, has expanded widely. It has been investigated from many perspectives, and many new and unexpected features have been uncovered from this theory. In recent decades, apart from high energy physics, the theory has been actively applied in other branches of physics, such as statistical physics, condensed matter physics, nonlinear systems, etc. This makes the theory an indispensable topic for all who are involved in physics. An international team of experts, each of whom has left his mark on the developments of this remarkable theory, contribute essays or more detailed technical accounts to this volume. These articles highlight the new discoveries from the respective authorsOCO perspectives. The distinguished contributors are: S Adler, F A Bais, C Becchi, M Creutz, A De Rjula, B S DeWitt, F Englert, L D Faddeev, P Hasenfratz, R Jackiw, A Polyakov, V N Popov, R Stora, P van Baal, P van Nieuwenhuizen, S Weinberg, F Wilczek, E Witten, C N Yang. Included in each article are introductory and explanatory remarks by the editor, G OCOt Hooft, who is himself a major player in the development of Yang-Mills theory.\"",

            "description": "Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF or GCSF) is a secreted glycoprotein that stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of granulocyte precursor cells, and induces mobilization of peripheral blood progenitor cells from the bone marrow. Development of recombinant human G-CSF has had a profound impact on the treatment of many diseases, including severe chronic neutropenia and cancer, and has enabled peripheral stem cell transplantation to supplant bone marrow transplantation in the autologous setting. This Milestones in Drug Therapy volume describes the experience of the last 20 years of treatment with recombinant human G-CSF, including the basic science, the use of recombinant human G-CSF in both the oncology and nononcology settings, and the safety and economics of its use. Many of the authors were the original investigators of recombinant human G-CSF and other authors are key researchers who provide their outlook for the next 20 years for use of and research with recombinant human G-CSF.",

H... Control and Its Applications examines both the theoretical and practical aspects of H... control from the angle of the structural properties of linear systems. Constructive algorithms for finding solutions to general singular H... control problems are presented, as well as solutions to general H... almost disturbance decoupling problems, and the applications of the theory to real-life problems with actual implementations is also presented. The book deals with all such issues for general continuous - and discrete-time systems. The book can be used in graduate courses in departments of aeronautics and astronautics, applied mathematics, chemical engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering. It is also invaluable for practising engineers in industry.",

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study.

            "description": "The advent of H∞-control was a truly remarkable innovation in multivariable theory. It eliminated the classical/modern dichotomy that had been a major source of the long-standing skepticism about the applicability of modern control theory, by amalgamating the \"philosophy\" of classical design with \"computation\" based on the state-space problem setting. It enhanced the application by deepening the theory mathematically and logically, not by weakening it as was done by the reformers of modern control theory in the early 1970s. The purpose of this book is to provide a natural theoretical framework that is understandable with little mathematical background. The notion of chain-scattering, well known in classical circuit theory, but new to control theorists, plays a fundamental role in this book. It captures an essential feature of the control systems design, reducing it to a J-lossless factorization, which leads naturally to the idea of H-infinity-control. The J-lossless conjugation, an essentially new notion in linear system theory, then provides a powerful tool for computing this factorization. Thus the chain-scattering representation, the J-lossless factorization, and the J-lossless conjugation are the three key notions that provide the thread of development in this book. The book is completely self contained and requires little mathematical background other than some familiarity with linear algebra. It will be useful to applied mathematicians and practicing engineers in control system design and as a text for a graduate course in H∞-control and its applications.",

I was ?rst getting in touch with the DVB technology when I was doing my PhD research in Brunel University in UK in 2002. At that time DVB-T was already a mature and widely used digital broadcast technology and anyone could easily buy a DVB-T receiver in the market to try the digital broadcast signals that have been already broadcasted in UK since 1998. Then the DVB technology world changed dramatically. As a more ?exible and robust terr- trial broadcast system targeting handsets, DVB-H was developed based on DVB-T. In 2003 the DVB-H community were continuously working to ?n- ize the standard. Finally in November 2004 DVB-H was adopted as an ETSI standard EN 302 304. I was lucky to see all these changes when I was doing my PhD research in DVB technology. And I was very proud to be involved in the di?erent DVB-H research projects since the beginning of the DVB-H standard development stage. I was also lucky enough that I am one of the ?rst persons who ?nished PhD degree by focusing on DVB-H research.",

Traditional phone companies can use IP Multicast technology to deliver video services over their networks; cell phone companies can use it to stream video to handheld phones and PDAs; and many cable TV companies are considering upgrading to IP technology. In addition to applications in industries seeking to provide high-quality digital video and audio, there are numerous other practical uses: multi-site corporate videoconferencing; broad distribution of financial data, stock quotes, and news bulletins; database replication; software distribution; and content caching (for example, Web site caching). After an introduction that gets readers up to speed on the basics, IP Multicast with Applications to IPTV and Mobile DVB-H: Discusses multicast addressing for payload and payload forwarding Covers routing in a variety of protocols, including PIM-SM, CBT, PIM-DM, DVMRP, and MOSPF Discusses multicasting in IPv6 environments and Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) Features examples of IP Multicast applications in the IPTV and mobile DVB-H environments Includes reference RFCs and protocols placed in the proper context of a commercial-grade infrastructure for the delivery of robust, entertainment-quality linear and nonlinear video programming This is a concise, compact reference for practitioners who seek a quick, practical review of the topic with an emphasis on the major and most often used aspects of the technology. It serves as a hands-on resource for engineers in the communications industry or Internet design, content providers, and researchers. It's also an excellent text for college courses on IP Multicast and/or IPTV.",

It was decided to bring out a new book, mostly dealing with recent applications in statistical distributions, pa- way models, nonextensive statistical mechanics, astrophysics problems, fractional calculus, etc. and to make use of the expertise of Hans J. Haubold in astrophysics area also. It was decided to con ne the discussion toH-function of one scalar variable only. Matrix variable cases and many variable cases are not discussed in detail, but an insight into these areas is given. When going from one variable to many variables, there is nothing called a unique bivariate or multivariate analogue of a givenfunction. Whatever be the criteria used, there may be manydifferentfunctions quali ed to be bivariate or multivariate analogues of a given univariate function.

Gass writes in his essays about the world within the word and the soul inside the sentence, yet readers often find it difficult to get far enough into Gass's words and sentences to find the world or soul they contain. In this guide to the American writer and philosopher's novels, short stories, novellas, and essays, H. L. Hix clarifies the obscurities that have served to limit access to Gass's corpus and explores how the parallels between his fiction and nonfiction illumine their related themes. Hix offers readings of Gass's works, from the early books, Omensetter's Luck and In the Heart of the Heart of the Country, to his later The Tunnel and Cartesian Sonata. Hix identifies the continuous presence of psychological, metaphysical, and ethical themes, including the lingering effect on adults of childhood hurts, the results of being trapped in language, and the consequences of hatred. While agreeing with critics who label Gass's novels and stories metafiction, he contends that to stop the exploration there would be to miss a complete appreciation of the novelist. Hix demonstrates instead how Gass's writings both break",

            "description": "Biography -- Literary Criticism--\u003e Conversations with William H. Gass captures the imagination and philosophical acumen of one of America's most important aestheticians, critical theorists, fiction writers, and essayists. From his first major novel, Omensetter's Luck (1966), to his numerous collections of essays and philosophical inquiries, to his controversial novel The Tunnel (1995), Gass (b. 1924) has proved himself a meticulous craftsman. Throughout these interviews, he reveals an aesthetic that combines ideas from sources as disparate as Ludwig Wittgenstein, Rainer Maria Rilke, Gertrude Stein, and Plato. The interviews make clear the unity behind Gass's views is by his own design. Conversations retrace his undergraduate years at Kenyon College and his subsequent philosophical investigation of metaphor at Cornell University. Gass has never strayed from his belief that metaphor is central and fundamental to thought and to aesthetics. In these interviews he reiterates time and again his belief that the ultimate understanding of the relationship of language to the world pivots on one's understanding of metaphor. In interviews, in profiles, and in his own essays, Gass does not hide from questions about his art and personal motivations, no matter how frequently they are asked, nor does he toy with his interviewers. Revealing how he never shies from an intellectual joust, this collection includes a rousing, contentious debate with John Gardner, fellow literary pundit and fiction writer. The distinction of Gass's prose is matched by the clarity and brilliance of the mind behind it. These talks allow an unobstructed view. Anyone interested in Gass's writing will delight in hearing the brutally honest voice of the mind that produced it. Theodore G. Ammon is chair of the philosophy department at Millsaps College in Jackson, Miss. His work has appeared in such publications as Romance Notes, Arachne, College Mathematics, and the Journal of Aesthetic Education.",

The theory used here truly offers a technique that enables us to design control systems that are reasonably insensitive to math modeling errors and can withstand disturbances such as gust, and in addition it doesnâ€™t need external states estimator, such as Kalman filtering. Extensive simulation results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, are presented in this book. Basic rocket theory and a concept of H-infinity control system design technique are explained for those who are new in these fields of study.",

            "description": "Frank H. Knight (1885-1972) was a central figure—many say the dominant influence—in the development of the \"Chicago School of Economics\" at the University of Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s, where he taught future Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, James Buchanan, George Stigler, and many other notable scholars. It was Knight's embedded skepticism about the reach of economic knowledge that set the stage for the laissez-faire economics that matured at the University in the 1950s and 1960s. But as important as Knight's technical economic contributions were, he never strayed far from his broad philosophical interests and concern for the state of modern liberal democracy. Ross B. Emmett's selection of Knight's essays is the first to offer a comprehensive picture of the work of this notable social scientist over the span of his career. Included are not only Knight's most influential writings, but also a number of uncollected papers which have not previously been widely accessible. These essays illustrate Knight's views on the central debates regarding economics, social science, ethics, education, and modern liberalism. Volume 1: \"What is Truth\" in Economics? contains fifteen of Knight's papers up through 1940. Volume 2: Laissez Faire: Pro and Con includes fourteen of Knight's papers from 1940 through 1967, including \"Socialism: The Nature of the Problem\" and \"The Sickness of Liberal Society.\" These twenty-nine essays together stand not only as a monument to one of economics' most significant and original thinkers, but will also serve as an invaluable resource for economists, philosophers, and political scientists interested in the development of the western liberal tradition.",

Most of the results presented are based onH? control theory, or its stochastic counterpart, risk sensitive control theory. Central to the philosophy of the book is the notion of an uncertain system. Uncertain systems are considered using several different uncertainty modeling schemes. These include norm bounded uncertainty, integral quadratic constraint (IQC) uncertainty and a number of stochastic uncertainty descriptions. In particular, the authors examine stochastic uncertain systems in which the uncertainty is outlined by a stochastic version of the IQC uncertainty description. For each class of uncertain systems covered in the book, corresponding robust control problems are defined and solutions discussed.",

Mira Wilkins, Business History Dunning is one of the most prominent researchers and thinkers in the IB field. In these books, he has set out his most celebrated writings and has provided us relatively easy access to widely scattered references in the literature. Rajat Kathuria, Global Business Review The modern academic study of the multinational enterprise started with John Dunning s pioneering study of American Investment in British Manufacturing Industry in 1958. In the early 1970s he began to publish an influential and authoritative stream of papers integrating theoretical and empirical analysis of the multinational enterprise. This fascinating volume charts the evolution of John Dunning s thinking, highlighting his attempts to develop a richer, more dynamic and historical framework for the analysis of the multinational enterprise. It makes compelling reading, and offers unique insights into the intellectual development of his well-known eclectic paradigm of international production. Mark Casson, University of Reading, UK This volume contains a selection of John Dunning s best known and highly acclaimed writings on the theory of international business activity. Spanning more than three decades, the 16 contributions trace the evolution of his thoughts and ideas as an economist, from his first article on the determinants of international production, published in 1973, to his most recent essay on relational assets, networks and global business activity, completed in 2002. Theories and Paradigms of International Business Activity gives particular prominence to the author s much renowned eclectic paradigm, which he first promulgated at a Nobel Symposium on the international allocation of economic activity in 1976. Since then, the author has written over 60 articles, pamphlets and chapters in books which have extended, refined and updated his theorizing on the interface between trade, FDI and MNE activity, in the light of the changing characteristics of the world economy and advances in international business scholarship. This, the first of two volumes of John Dunning s work, is essential reading for all students, scholars and researchers with a special interest in the reasons behind the explosive growth in post-war FDI and the globalization of business activity.",

He published a number of memorable short stories in the premier science fiction magazine of the time, Astounding Science Fiction, under legendary editor John W. Campbell. Piper quickly became friends with many of the top writers of the day, including Lester Del Rey, Fletcher Pratt, Robert Heinlein and L. Sprague de Camp. Piper also successfully made the turn from promising short story writer to major novelist, authoring Four-Day Planet, Cosmic Computer, Lord Kalvan of Otherwhen and Little Fuzzy, which was nominated for a Hugo award. Even those who counted Piper among their friends knew very little about the man or his life as a railroad yard bull in Altoona, Pennsylvania. This biography illuminates H. Beam Piper, both the writer and the man, and answers lingering questions about his death. Appendices include a number of Piper's personal papers, a complete bibliography of Piper's works, and an essay on Piper's Terro-Human Future History series.",

A profound novel about the claims of identity, history, family, and the burdens of a broken world.” —Maureen Corrigan, NPR’s “Fresh Air” In the book of Genesis, when God calls out, “Abraham!” before ordering him to sacrifice his son, Isaac, Abraham responds, “Here I am.” Later, when Isaac calls out, “My father!” before asking him why there is no animal to slaughter, Abraham responds, “Here I am.” How do we fulfill our conflicting duties as father, husband, and son; wife and mother; child and adult? Jew and American? How can we claim our own identities when our lives are linked so closely to others’? These are the questions at the heart of Jonathan Safran Foer’s first novel in eleven years—a work of extraordinary scope and heartbreaking intimacy. Unfolding over four tumultuous weeks in present-day Washington, D.C., Here I Am is the story of a fracturing family in a moment of crisis. As Jacob and Julia Bloch and their three sons are forced to confront the distances between the lives they think they want and the lives they are living, a catastrophic earthquake sets in motion a quickly escalating conflict in the Middle East. At stake is the meaning of home—and the fundamental question of how much aliveness one can bear. Showcasing the same high-energy inventiveness, hilarious irreverence, and emotional urgency that readers loved in his earlier work, Here I Am is Foer’s most searching, hard-hitting, and grandly entertaining novel yet. It not only confirms Foer’s stature as a dazzling literary talent but reveals a novelist who has fully come into his own as one of our most important writers.",

It was a pretty radical idea-a channel for teenagers, showing nothing but music videos. It was such a radical idea that almost no one thought it would actually succeed, much less become a force in the worlds of music, television, film, fashion, sports, and even politics. But it did work. MTV became more than anyone had ever imagined. I Want My MTV tells the story of the first decade of MTV, the golden era when MTV's programming was all videos, all the time, and kids watched religiously to see their favorite bands, learn about new music, and have something to talk about at parties. From its start in 1981 with a small cache of videos by mostly unknown British new wave acts to the launch of the reality-television craze with The Real World in 1992, MTV grew into a tastemaker, a career maker, and a mammoth business. Featuring interviews with nearly four hundred artists, directors, VJs, and television and music executives, I Want My MTV is a testament to the channel that changed popular culture forever.",

            "description": "As a creative force, student of the human heart and soul, and champion of living the life you want, Oprah Winfrey stands alone. Over the years, she has made history with a legendary talk show - the highest-rated program of its kind, launched her own television network, become the nation's only African-American billionaire, and been awarded both an honorary degree by Harvard University and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. From all her experiences, she has gleaned life lessons—which, for fourteen years, she's shared in O, The Oprah Magazine's widely popular \"What I Know For Sure\" column, a monthly source of inspiration and revelation. Now, for the first time, these thoughtful gems have been revised, updated, and collected in What I Know For Sure, a beautiful cloth bound book with a ribbon marker, packed with insight and revelation from Oprah Winfrey. Organized by theme—joy, resilience, connection, gratitude, possibility, awe, clarity, and power—these essays offer a rare, powerful and intimate glimpse into the heart and mind of one of the world's most extraordinary women—while providing readers a guide to becoming their best selves. Candid, moving, exhilarating, uplifting, and frequently humorous, the words Oprah shares in What I Know For Sure shimmer with the sort of truth that readers will turn to again and again.",

I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings captures the longing of lonely children, the brute insult of bigotry, and the wonder of words that can make the world right. Maya Angelou’s debut memoir is a modern American classic beloved worldwide. Sent by their mother to live with their devout, self-sufficient grandmother in a small Southern town, Maya and her brother, Bailey, endure the ache of abandonment and the prejudice of the local “powhitetrash.” At eight years old and back at her mother’s side in St. Louis, Maya is attacked by a man many times her age—and has to live with the consequences for a lifetime. Years later, in San Francisco, Maya learns that love for herself, the kindness of others, her own strong spirit, and the ideas of great authors (“I met and fell in love with William Shakespeare”) will allow her to be free instead of imprisoned. Poetic and powerful, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings will touch hearts and change minds for as long as people read. “I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings liberates the reader into life simply because Maya Angelou confronts her own life with such a moving wonder, such a luminous dignity.”—James Baldwin From the Paperback edition.",

With these three, simple directives, Isaac Asimov changed our perception of robots forever when he formulated the laws governing their behavior. In I, Robot, Asimov chronicles the development of the robot through a series of interlinked stories: from its primitive origins in the present to its ultimate perfection in the not-so-distant future--a future in which humanity itself may be rendered obsolete. Here are stories of robots gone mad, of mind-read robots, and robots with a sense of humor. Of robot politicians, and robots who secretly run the world--all told with the dramatic blend of science fact and science fiction that has become Asmiov's trademark.",

            "description": "I Swear I Saw This records visionary anthropologist Michael Taussig’s reflections on the fieldwork notebooks he kept through forty years of travels in Colombia. Taking as a starting point a drawing he made in Medellin in 2006—as well as its caption, “I swear I saw this”—Taussig considers the fieldwork notebook as a type of modernist literature and the place where writers and other creators first work out the imaginative logic of discovery. Notebooks mix the raw material of observation with reverie, juxtaposed, in Taussig’s case, with drawings, watercolors, and newspaper cuttings, which blend the inner and outer worlds in a fashion reminiscent of Brion Gysin and William Burroughs’s surreal cut-up technique. Focusing on the small details and observations that are lost when writers convert their notes into finished pieces, Taussig calls for new ways of seeing and using the notebook as form. Memory emerges as a central motif in I Swear I Saw This as he explores his penchant to inscribe new recollections in the margins or directly over the original entries days or weeks after an event. This palimpsest of afterthoughts leads to ruminations on Freud’s analysis of dreams, Proust’s thoughts on the involuntary workings of memory, and Benjamin’s theories of history—fieldwork, Taussig writes, provokes childhood memories with startling ease. I Swear I Saw This exhibits Taussig’s characteristic verve and intellectual audacity, here combined with a revelatory sense of intimacy. He writes, “drawing is thus a depicting, a hauling, an unraveling, and being impelled toward something or somebody.” Readers will exult in joining Taussig once again as he follows the threads of a tangled skein of inspired associations.",

Twenty years of experience treating men and their families has convinced psychotherapist Terrence Real that depression is a silent epidemic in men—that men hide their condition from family, friends, and themselves to avoid the stigma of depression’s “un-manliness.” Problems that we think of as typically male—difficulty with intimacy, workaholism, alcoholism, abusive behavior, and rage—are really attempts to escape depression. And these escape attempts only hurt the people men love and pass their condition on to their children. This groundbreaking book is the “pathway out of darkness” that these men and their families seek. Real reveals how men can unearth their pain, heal themselves, restore relationships, and break the legacy of abuse. He mixes penetrating analysis with compelling tales of his patients and even his own experiences with depression as the son of a violent, depressed father and the father of two young sons.",

Hailed as \"astonishing and disturbing\" by the Financial Times and \"essential reading\" by TechCrunch at its original publication, former American Apparel marketing director Ryan Holiday’s first book sounded a prescient alarm about the dangers of fake news. It's all the more relevant today. Trust Me, I’m Lying was the first book to blow the lid off the speed and force at which rumors travel online—and get \"traded up\" the media ecosystem until they become real headlines and generate real responses in the real world. The culprit? Marketers and professional media manipulators, encouraged by the toxic economics of the news business. Whenever you see a malicious online rumor costs a company millions, politically motivated fake news driving elections, a product or celebrity zooming from total obscurity to viral sensation, or anonymously sourced articles becoming national conversation, someone is behind it. Often someone like Ryan Holiday. As he explains, “I wrote this book to explain how media manipulators work, how to spot their fingerprints, how to fight them, and how (if you must) to emulate their tactics. Why am I giving away these secrets? Because I’m tired of a world where trolls hijack debates, marketers help write the news, opinion masquerades as fact, algorithms drive everything to extremes, and no one is accountable for any of it. I’m pulling back the curtain because it’s time the public understands how things really work. What you choose to do with this information is up to you.”",

Considered one of the most readable biographies of Martin Luther, this volume is an illustrated look at the German religious reformer and his influence on Western civilization. Martin Luther entered a monastery as a youth and as a man shattered the structure of the medieval church. Luther spoke out against the corrupt religious practices that then existed. His demand that the authority for doctrine and practice be Scriptures, rather than Popes or Councils, echoed around the world and ignited the Great Reformation. Accused of heresy and threatened with excommunication and death, Luther maintained his bold stand and refused to recant. In his crusade to eliminate religious abuses, he did more than any other man to establish the Protestant faith. With sound historical scholarship and penetrating insight, Roland Bainton examines Luther's widespread influence. He re-creates the spiritual setting of the sixteenth century, showing Luther's place within it and influence upon it. Richly illustrated with more than 100 woodcuts and engravings from Luther's own time, Here I Standdramatically brings to life Martin Luther, the great reformer. Bainton published Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Lutherin 1950. As of 2008, it is still in print. Kenneth Scott Latourette, in the chapter notes for \"Luther and the Rise and Spread of Lutheranism\" in his History of Christianity, lauds Bainton's biography of Luther as \"A superb combination of accurate scholarship based upon a thorough knowledge of the sources and secondary works with insight, vivid, readable literary style, and reproductions of contemporary illustrations. It also contains so valuable a bibliography as to render needless an extended one in this chapter.\" In his chapter on Luther's writings in Invitation to the Classics, Mark A. Noll singles out Bainton's biography: \"Of the many superlative treatments, a half-century old study by Roland Bainton, Here I Stand: A Life of Martin Luther, has justly won a reputation as a classic work on a classic subject.\"",

The book is Boris Vian's (1920-1959) sex-and-violence-filled homage to American noir. Originally published in France as J'IRAI CRACHER SUR VOS TOMBES--after allegedly being censored in the U.S. and translated into French--the novel was a best seller, establishing Vian as one of the most famous writers of the mid-twentieth century.",

Unable to find a satisfactory analysis of the subject, the author proceeded to write his own. This book largely organized itself: an exposition and discussion of the ideology naturally occupied the central position, preceded by a brief treatment of its proponents. But Official Nationality reached beyond intellectual circles, lectures and books; indeed, for thirty years it ruled Russia. Therefore, the author found it necessary to write a chapter on the emperor who, in effect, personally dominated and governed the country throughout his reign; to add a section on the imperial family, the ministers, and some other high officials to an account of the intellectuals who supported the state; and to sketch the application of Official Nationalty both in home affairs and in foreign policy. In this manner this title is able to bring the state doctrine and its role in Russian history into proper focus.",

Her aunt goes away on business soon after Daisy arrives. The next day bombs go off as London is attacked and occupied by an unnamed enemy. As power fails, and systems fail, the farm becomes more isolated. Despite the war, it’s a kind of Eden, with no adults in charge and no rules, a place where Daisy’s uncanny bond with her cousins grows into something rare and extraordinary. But the war is everywhere, and Daisy and her cousins must lead each other into a world that is unknown in the scariest, most elemental way. A riveting and astonishing story.",

            "description": "In this moving and unexpected book, Joan Didion reassesses parts of her life, her work, her history, and ours. Where I Was From, in Didion’s words, “represents an exploration into my own confusions about the place and the way in which I grew up, confusions as much about America as about California, misapprehensions and misunderstandings so much a part of who I became that I can still to this day confront them only obliquely.” The book is a haunting narrative of how her own family moved west with the frontier from the birth of her great-great-great-great-great-grandmother in Virginia in 1766 to the death of her mother on the edge of the Pacific in 2001; of how the wagon-train stories of hardship and abandonment and endurance created a culture in which survival would seem the sole virtue. In Where I Was From, Didion turns what John Leonard has called “her sonar ear, her radar eye” onto her own work, as well as that of such California writers as Frank Norris and Jack London and Henry George, to examine how the folly and recklessness in the very grain of the California settlement led to the California we know today–a state mortgaged first to the railroad, then to the aerospace industry, and overwhelmingly to the federal government, a dependent colony of those political and corporate owners who fly in for the annual encampment of the Bohemian Club. Here is the one writer we always want to read on California showing us the startling contradictions in its–and in America’s–core values. Joan Didion’s unerring sense of America and its spirit, her acute interpretation of its institutions and literature, and her incisive questioning of the stories it tells itself make this fiercely intelligent book a provocative and important tour de force from one of our greatest writers.

J is the title that scholars ascribe to the nameless writer they believe is responsible for the text, written between 950 and 900 BCE, on which Genesis, Exodus, and Numbers is based. In The Book of J, accompanying David Rosenberg's translation, Harold Bloom persuasively argues that J was a woman?very likely a woman of the royal house at King Solomon's court?and a writer of the stature of Homer, Shakespeare, and Tolstoy. Rosenberg's translations from the Hebrew bring J's stories to life and reveal her towering originality and grasp of humanity. Bloom argues in several essays that \"J\" was not a religious writer but a fierce ironist. He also offers historical context, a discussion of the theory of how the different texts came together to create the Bible, and translation notes.",

Many people wish to experience the reality behind the media images, or are prompted to find out more by a personal association with places or events. The phenomenon raises ethical issues over the status and nature of objects, the extent of their interpretation, the appropriate political and managerial response and the nature of the experience as perceived by the visitor, their residents and local residents. Events, sites, types of visit and a hosta reactions are considered in order to construct the parameters of the concept of a dark tourisma . Many acts of inhumanity are celebrated as heritage sites in Britain (for example, the Tower of London, Edinburgh Castle), and the Berlin Wall has become a significant attraction despite claiming many victims.",

            "description": "This anthology exhibits the diversity, inventiveness, and intellectual energy of the writings of J. Hillis Miller, the most significant North American literary critic of the twentieth century. From the 1950s onward, Miller has made invaluable contributions to our understanding of the practice and theory of literary criticism, the ethics and responsibilities of teaching and reading, and the role of literature in the modern world. He has also shown successive generations of scholars and students the necessity of comprehending the relationship between philosophy and literature. Divided into six sections, the volume provides more than twenty significant extracts from Miller’s works. In addition, there is a new interview with Miller, as well as a series of specially commissioned critical responses to Miller’s work by a number of the leading figures in literary and cultural studies today. Following a comprehensive critical introduction by the editor, each section has a brief introduction, directing the reader toward pertinent themes. There is also a comprehensive bibliography and a chronology of Miller’s professional life and activities. This reader, the first of Miller's work in English, provides an indispensable overview and introduction to one of the most original critical voices to have emerged since the inception of the teaching of English and American literature in universities in the English-speaking world.",

            "description": "At the end of World War II, J. Robert Oppenheimer was one of America's preeminent physicists. For his work as director of the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Medal for Merit, the highest honor the U.S. government can bestow on a civilian. Yet, in 1953, Oppenheimer was denied security clearance amidst allegations that he was \"more probably than not\" an \"agent of the Soviet Union.\" Determined to clear his name, he insisted on a hearing before the Atomic Energy Commission's Personnel Security Board.In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer contains an edited and annotated transcript of the 1954 hearing, as well as the various reports resulting from it. Drawing on recently declassified FBI files, Richard Polenberg's introductory and concluding essays situate the hearing in the Cold War period, and his thoughtful analysis helps explain why the hearing was held, why it turned out as it did, and what that result meant, both for Oppenheimer and for the United States.Among the forty witnesses who testified were many who had played vitally important roles in the making of U.S. nuclear policy: Enrico Fermi, Hans Bethe, Edward Teller, Vannevar Bush, George F. Kennan, and Oppenheimer himself. The hearing provides valuable insights into the development of the atomic bomb and the postwar debate among scientists over the hydrogen bomb, the conflict between the foreign policy and military establishments over national defense, and the controversy over the proper standards to apply in assessing an individual's loyalty. It reveals as well the fears and anxieties that plagued America during the Cold War era.",

However, transformer talent is at a premium today, and all aspects of the power industry are suffering a diminishing of the supply of knowledgeable and experienced engineers. Now in print for over 80 years since initial publication in 1925 by Johnson & Phillips Ltd, the J & P Transformer Book continues to withstand the test of time as a key body of reference material for students, teachers, and all whose careers are involved in the engineering processes associated with power delivery, and particularly with transformer design, manufacture, testing, procurement, application, operation, maintenance, condition assessment and life extension. Current experience and knowledge have been brought into this thirteenth edition with discussions on moisture equilibrium in the insulation system, vegetable based natural ester insulating fluids, industry concerns with corrosive sulphur in oil, geomagnetic induced current (GIC) impacts, transportation issues, new emphasis on measurement of load related noise, and enhanced treatment of dielectric testing (including Frequency Response Analysis), Dissolved Gas analysis (DGA) techniques and tools, vacuum LTCs, shunt and series reactors, and HVDC converter transformers. These changes in the thirteenth edition together with updates of IEC reference Standards documentation and inclusion for the first time of IEEE reference Standards, provide recognition that the transformer industry and market is truly global in scale. -- From the foreword by Donald J. Fallon Martin Heathcote is a consultant specializing in power transformers, primarily working for utilities. In this context he has established working relationships with transformer manufacturers on several continents. His background with Ferranti and the UK’s Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) included transformer design and the management and maintenance of transformer-based systems. * The definitive reference for all involved in designing, installing, monitoring and maintaining high-voltage systems using power transformers (electricity generation and distribution sector; large-scale industrial applications) * The classic reference work on power transformers and their applications: first published in 1925, now brought fully up to date in this thirteenth edition * A truly practical engineering approach to design, monitoring and maintenance of power transformers – in electricity generation, substations, and industrial applications.",

He demonstrates that, contrary to the standard claims of classical source criticism, the J and E sources were never combined into a \"JE\" document. Rather, these two sources were combined with each other at the same time that they were combined with the P and D documents, in one process of redaction.After investigating the history of scholarly arguments regarding the existence and combination of J and E, the author goes on to argue in detail for the dependence of D on the separate, independent narratives of J and, primarily, E. Significant attention is paid to the issue of redaction. In particular, Baden critiques the manner in which passages have traditionally been attributed to redactors, and argues for a more restrictive concept of the redactor and his work. It is further argued that the literary evidence in the Pentateuch provides for the existence of only a single redactor, to whom the compilation of all four sources of the Pentateuch is to be attributed.In the course of this study, a number of important questions regarding the composition of the Pentateuch are addressed: the existence of E, the relationship between D and the narratives of Genesis-Numbers, and the nature of the redactor. In the end, this study stands as both a critique of traditional documentary analysis of the Pentateuch and a defense of its fundamental claims.",

            "description": "The son and grandson of slaves owned by abolitionist Moses Brown, William J. Brown was a free African American born in Providence in 1814. Brown published his captivating autobiography, The Life of William J. Brown of Providence, R.I., in 1883. His compelling and insightful story is a memorable portrait of life and society in nineteenth-century New England: his childhood, his unusually good educational opportunities, employment, contemporary race relations, the port's bustling seafaring life, temperance, religion, organized societies, and local and national politics. He wrote of prominent African American contemporaries, including Frederick Douglass and Henry Bibb, and of African American troops in the Civil War. This is an impressively rich text, remarkable for its time and place. Unlike official records and other types of primary sources--frequently written from the opaque, self-interested perspective of upper-middle-class white Americans--this extraordinary memoir provides an authentic window on black experiences in nineteenth-century New England. Expertly framed by Rosalind C. Wiggins's engaging preface and a new scholarly introduction by historian Joanne Pope Melish, The Life of William J. Brown of Providence, R.I. will spellbind readers interested in African American and New England literature, history, and culture.",

Yet, for many-from experienced scientists to trainees-it represents a (rather too) sophisticated process whose true insight is excessively demanding. However, when not simplyconsidered as a private ground for a few aficionados, it can be seen as a way of understanding how maturelympho cytes carry on their basic functions. For the group of aficionados-which includes this editor-it is an elegant paradigm featuring many fascinating evolutionary achievements of which the biological world alone has the secret. These include a subtle biochemical principle most likelyhijacked some 470 million years ago from an ancestral gene invader and since then cleverly adapted by jawed vertebrates to precisely cleave and rearrange their antigen receptor (Ig andTCR)loci. This invader would itself have assigned the services of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNArepair machinery as well as various DNApolymerases or transferases to work in concert with developmental clues in lymphoid cell lineages to generate an immune repertoire and efficient host surveillance while avoiding autoimmunity. Recently, important new refinements in these systems have emerged, continuing to challenge ourknowledge andbeliefs. These arejust thetopics covered by the senior authors-all established leaders in this field-and their colleagues, whilst writing the various chapters in V(D)J Recombination.",

Krishnamurti is like a beautiful garland of many fragrant flowers. It comprises carefully selected quotations from Krishnamurti`s utterrances on a wide range of spiritual and philosophical topics. This book is the first one of its kind ever to be published relating to the teachings of Krishnamurti. It is a collection of 514 of his sayings up to year 1968. Alphabetically arranged like a dictionary under 118 different subject headings, this invaluable reference book helps one to find out quickly what Krishnamurti has said on important subjects such as Awareness, Concentration, Fear, Happiness, Love, Meditation, etc. At the end of every quotation a statement is given indicating its source. In this way the interested reader is assisted not only to check the authenticity of a quotation but also its context. This excellent compilation will always be treasured because it is the quintessence of the message of one of the greatest Teachers of all time. About the Auther: Susunaga Weeraperuma, the compile of Sayings of J. Krishnamurti is internationally known as the compiler of the only existent bibliography of Krishnamurti, entitled A Bibliography of the life and Teachings of Jiddu Krishnamurti, now published as iddu Krishnamurti: A Bibliographical Guide. Weeraperuma is extremely well acquainted with all the writings of J. Krishnamurti as well as the corpus of literature, in different languages, on Krishnamurti.

A Democrat, Flood represented Pennsylvania's 11th Congressional District for thirty-one years. His ability to provide for his depressed district emanated mainly from his chairmanship of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor-HEW. Flood surpassed most of his colleagues in the extremism of his anti-Communist rhetoric. Focusing frequently on Eastern Europe helped him politically, given the demographics of the district. But his real obsession was the Panama Canal. He advocated permanent U.S. possession of the canal and Canal Zone and publicized the issue from 1958 until 1978, his next-to-last year in office, Flood's career ended with his indictment and trial on a variety of corruption charges. A plea agreement allowed him to evade prison time, but he resigned his long-held seat in January 1980 and remains a figure whose achievements are clouded by scandal. Now an independent scholar, Sheldon Spear is retired from the history department at Luzerne County Community College.",

In best-selling books such as Tales of Old-Time Texas, Coronado's Children, and The Longhorns, Dobie captured the Southwest's folk history, which was quickly disappearing as the United States became ever more urbanized and industrial. Renowned as \"Mr. Texas,\" Dobie paradoxically has almost disappeared from view—a casualty of changing tastes in literature and shifts in social and political attitudes since the 1960s. In this lively biography, Steven L. Davis takes a fresh look at a J. Frank Dobie whose \"liberated mind\" set him on an intellectual journey that culminated in Dobie becoming a political liberal who fought for labor, free speech, and civil rights well before these causes became acceptable to most Anglo Texans. Tracing the full arc of Dobie's life (1888–1964), Davis shows how Dobie's insistence on \"free-range thinking\" led him to such radical actions as calling for the complete integration of the University of Texas during the 1940s, as well as taking on governors, senators, and the FBI (which secretly investigated him) as Texas's leading dissenter during the McCarthy era.",

            "description": "The life of the beloved hymn writer told in her own words. Frances Jane Crosby (1820 - 1915), usually known as Fanny Crosby, was an American lyricist best known for her Protestant Christian hymns. She was one of the most prolific hymnists in history, writing over 8,000 hymns, despite being blind from shortly after birth. Also known for her preaching and speaking, during her lifetime Fanny Crosby was one of the best known women in the United States. To this day the vast majority of American hymnals contain her work. Some of her best known songs include \"Blessed Assurance,\" \"Jesus Is Tenderly Calling You Home,\" \"Praise Him, Praise Him,\" and \"To God Be the Glory.\" Since some publishers were hesitant to have so many hymns by one person in their hymnals, Crosby used nearly 100 different pseudonyms during her career. Fanny Crosby entered what was then known as the New York Institution for the Blind at the age of fifteen and afterward taught English and history (1847 - 58). As a pupil and as a teacher, Fanny spent 35 years at the school. She was often asked to entertain visitors with her poems, and she frequently met with presidents, generals and other dignitaries. She was asked to play at President Grant's funeral. Her first book of poems, published in 1844, was called The Blind Girl and Other Poems. After leaving the school, she dedicated her life to serving the poorest and the neediest. Supporting herself by her writing, she quickly gained fame for her hymns. Her usual fee was a mere two dollars which frequently went to her work with the poor. Her mission work is legendary as is her devotion to serving others above herself. Long unavailable, this is the story (originally published in 1906 as Memories of Eighty Years) of a remarkable life, told by Miss Crosby herself. HENDRICKSON CLASSIC BIOGRAPHIESfeature enduring stories about real people whose lives have been touched and transformed by God, and who in turn have touched others with God's love. Each story has been carefully selected, gently edited if necessary, and freshly typeset, making every account be it ancient or contemporary a compelling read. Great lives reaching across the ages to touch lives today, encouraging, challenging, and inspiring.",

            "description": "Melville J. Herskovits and the Racial Politics of Knowledgeis the first full-scale biography of the trailblazing anthropologist of African and African American cultures. Born into a world of racial hierarchy, Melville J. Herskovits (1895?1963) employed physical anthropology and ethnography to undermine racist and hierarchical ways of thinking about humanity and to underscore the value of cultural diversity. His research in West Africa, the West Indies, and South America documented the far-reaching influence of African cultures in the Americas. He founded the first major interdisciplinary American program in African studies in 1948 at Northwestern University, and his controversial classicThe Myth of the Negro Pastdelineated African cultural influences on American blacks and showcased the vibrancy of African American culture. He also helped forge the concept of cultural relativism, particularly in his bookMan and His Works. While Herskovits promoted African and African American studies, he criticized some activist black scholars, most notably Carter G. Woodson and W. E. B. Du Bois, whom he considered propagandists because of their social reform orientation. ø After World War II, Herskovits became an outspoken public figure, advocating African independence and attacking American policymakers who treated Africa as an object of Cold War strategy. Drawing extensively on Herskovits?s private papers and published works, Jerry Gershenhorn?s biography recognizes Herskovits?s many contributions and discusses the complex consequences of his conclusions, methodologies, and relations with African American scholars.",

            "description": "The late Abraham Pais, author of the award winning biography of Albert Einstein, Subtle is the Lord, here offers an illuminating portrait of another of his eminent colleagues, J. Robert Oppenheimer, one of the most charismatic and enigmatic figures of modern physics. Pais introduces us to a precocious youth who sped through Harvard in three years, made signal contributions to quantum mechanics while in his twenties, and was instrumental in the growth of American physics in the decade before the Second World War, almost single-handedly bringing it to a state of prominence. He paints a revealing portrait of Oppenheimer's life in Los Alamos, where in twenty remarkable, feverish months, and under his inspired guidance, the first atomic bomb was designed and built, a success that made Oppenheimer America's most famous scientist. Pais describes Oppenheimer's long tenure as Director of the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton, where the two men worked together closely. He shows not only Oppenheimer's brilliance and leadership, but also how his displays of intensity and arrogance won him powerful enemies, ones who would ultimately make him one of the principal victims of the Red Scare of the 1950s. J. Robert Oppenheimer is Abraham Pais's final work, completed after his death by Robert P. Crease, an acclaimed historian of science in his own right. Told with compassion and deep insight, it is the most comprehensive biography of the great physicist available. Anyone seeking an insider's portrait of this enigmatic man will find it indispensable.",

(He was one of the best students that year, by the way. ) Because of his background, Fred has taken, in the Guide, the point of view of an experienced student tutor helping you to learn calculus. \\~ile we do not always think Fred's jokes are as funny as he does, we appreciate his enthusiasm and his desire to enter into communication with his readers; since we nearly always agree with the mathe matical judgements he has made in explaining the material, we believe that this Guide can serve you as a valuable supplement to our text. To get maximum benefit from this Guide, you should begin by spending a few moments to acquaint yourself with its structure. Once you get started in the course, take advantage of the many opportunities which the text and Student Guide together provide for learning calculus in the only way that any mathe matical subject can truly be mastered - through attempting to solve problems on your own. As you read the text, try doing each example and exercise your self before reading the solution; do the same with the quiz problems provided by Fred.",

The required prerequisites are only the standard one-year graduate algebra course and the standard introductory graduate course on algebraic and geometric topology. Many topics from algebraic topology, homological algebra, and algebraic number theory are developed as needed. The final chapter gives a concise introduction to cyclic homology and its interrelationship with K-Theory.",

Parkin suggests that saying F**k It is the perfect Western expression of the Eastern spiritual concept of letting go, giving up, and finding real freedom by realizing that things don't matter so much (if at all).It's a spiritual way that doesn't require chanting, meditating, or wearing sandals. And it's the very power of this modern-day profanity that makes it perfect for shaking us Westerners out of the stress and anxiety that dominate our daily lives.So, find out how to say F**k It to all your problems and concerns. Say F**k It to all the “shoulds” in your life, and finally do what you want—no matter what other people think!",

            "description": "From the Preface: K-theory was introduced by A. Grothendieck in his formulation of the Riemann- Roch theorem. For each projective algebraic variety, Grothendieck constructed a group from the category of coherent algebraic sheaves, and showed that it had many nice properties. Atiyah and Hirzebruch considered a topological analog defined for any compact space X, a group K{X) constructed from the category of vector bundles on X. It is this ''topological K-theory\" that this book will study. Topological K-theory has become an important tool in topology. Using K- theory, Adams and Atiyah were able to give a simple proof that the only spheres which can be provided with H-space structures are S1, S3 and S7. Moreover, it is possible to derive a substantial part of stable homotopy theory from K-theory. The purpose of this book is to provide advanced students and mathematicians in other fields with the fundamental material in this subject. In addition, several applications of the type described above are included. In general we have tried to make this book self-contained, beginning with elementary concepts wherever possible; however, we assume that the reader is familiar with the basic definitions of homotopy theory: homotopy classes of maps and homotopy groups.Thus this book might be regarded as a fairly self-contained introduction to a \"generalized cohomology theory\".",

Le Guin assembles interviews with the renowned science-fiction and fantasy author of The Left Hand of Darkness, The Dispossessed, The Lathe of Heaven, and the Earthsea sequence of novels and stories. For nearly five decades, Le Guin (b. 1929) has enjoyed immense success--both critical and popular--in science fiction and fantasy. But she has also published well-received works in such genres as realistic fiction, poetry, children's literature, criticism, and translation. In the pieces collected here, Le Guin takes every interview not as an opportunity to recapitulate long-held views but as an occasion for in-depth intellectual discourse. In interviews spanning over twenty-five years of her literary career, including a previously unpublished piece conducted by the volume's editor, Le Guin talks about such diverse subjects as U.S. foreign policy, the history of architecture, the place of women and feminist consciousness in American literature, and the differences between science fiction and fantasy. Carl Freedman is professor of English at Louisiana State University and is the author of Critical Theory and Science Fiction; The Incomplete Projects: Marxism, Modernity, and the Politics of Culture; and George Orwell: A Study in Ideology and Literary Form.",

            "description": "Wireless sensor networks have received significant attention because of their important role and many conveniences in our lives. Indeed, the recent and fast advances in inexpensive sensor technology and wireless communications has made the design and development of large-scale wireless sensor networks cost-effective and appealing to a wide range of mission-critical situations, including civilian, natural, industrial, and military applications, such as health and environmental monitoring, seism monitoring, industrial process automation, and battlefields surveillance, respectively. A wireless sensor network consists of a large number of tiny, low-powered devices, called sensors, which are randomly or deterministically deployed in a field of interest while collaborating and coordinating for the successful accomplishment of their mission. These sensors suffer from very scarce resources and capabilities, such as bandwidth, storage, CPU, battery power (or energy), sensing, and communication, to name a few, with energy being the most critical one. The major challenge in the design process of this type of network is mainly due to the limited capabilities of the sensors, and particularly, their energy, which makes them unreliable. This book aims to develop a reader’s thorough understanding of the opportunities and challenges of k-covered wireless sensor networks, where each point in a deployment field is covered (or sensed) by at least k sensors. Following René Descartes’ most elegant methodology of dividing each difficulty into as many parts as might be possible and necessary to best solve it (Discours de la Method, 1637), this book presents a variety of theoretical studies based on percolation theory and computational geometry, as well as protocols that lead to the design of a unified framework, where connected k-coverage, sensor scheduling, and data routing and dissemination are jointly considered.",

This meeting was jointly supported by NATO and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and was sponsored in part by the Canadian Mathematical Society. This book is the volume of proceedings for that meeting. Algebraic K-theory is essentially the study of homotopy invariants arising from rings and their associated matrix groups. More importantly perhaps, the subject has become central to the study of the relationship between Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Number Theory. It draws on all of these fields as a subject in its own right, but it serves as well as an effective translator for the application of concepts from one field in another. The papers in this volume are representative of the current state of the subject. They are, for the most part, research papers which are primarily of interest to researchers in the field and to those aspiring to be such. There is a section on problems in this volume which should be of particular interest to students; it contains a discussion of the problems from Gersten's well-known list of 1973, as well as a short list of new problems.",

It includes a detailed introduction to the necessary functional analysis, followed by an exploration of the connections between K-homology and operator theory, coarse geometry, index theory, and assembly maps, including a detailed treatment of the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem. Beginning with the rudiments of C* - algebra theory, the book will lead the reader to some central notions of contemporary research in geometric functional analysis.

The kind of world he predicted in his funny and frightening novels and stories is coming closer to most of us: shifting realities, unstable relations, uncertain moralities. Philip K. Dick: Exhilaration and Terror of the Postmodern examines a wide range of Dick's work, including his short stories and posthumously published realist novels. Christopher Palmer analyzes the puzzling and dazzling effects of Dick's fiction, and argues that at its heart is a clash between exhilarating possibilities of transformation, and a frightening lack of ethical certainties. Dick's work is seen as the inscription of his own historical predicament, the clash between humanism and postmodernism being played out in the complex forms of the fiction. The problem is never resolved, but Dick's ways of imagining it become steadily more ingenious and challenging.",

The book begins with a detailed discussion of vector bundles and related algebraic notions, followed by the definition of K-theory and proofs of the most important theorems in the subject, such as the Bott periodicity theorem and the Thom isomorphism theorem. The multiplicative structure of K-theory and the Adams operations are also discussed and the final chapter details the construction and computation of characteristic classes.

To date, however, the radical social, cultural, and political ramifications of Le Guin's multiple award-winning novel remain woefully under explored. Editors Laurence Davis and Peter Stillman right this state of affairs in the first ever collection of original essays devoted to Le Guin's novel. Among the topics covered in this wide-ranging, international and interdisciplinary collection are the anarchist, ecological, post-consumerist, temporal, revolutionary, and open-ended utopian politics of The Dispossessed. The book concludes with an essay by Le Guin written specially for this volume, in which she reassesses the novel in light of the development of her own thinking over the past 30 years.",

            "description": "Just how International and European Community Law is being integrated into domestic legal systems is as yet not too well known. To gain a clear overview of this grey area requires more than knowing about the various constitutional rules. What is also needed is a study of little-known administrative practices and the attitudes of the national courts, where case-law is often as complex as it is diverse. When all these elements are taken into account, the general picture that emerges is a much more subtle one, transcending the classical positions based on the theories of monism and dualism. To grasp this reality and go beyond preconceived ideas, it seemed indispensable to make a thorough analysis of national practices. To this end, the International Law Centre of the University of Paris XIII (Cedin Paris XIII) took the initiative, in 1990, of setting up a network of European international lawyers to work on the theme International norms and legal barriers'. This book presents the outcome of the network's programme. The research was organized on the basis of a single questionnaire which provided the outline of a common workplan, to which each of the contributors has adhered. Detailed comparisons of national practices can now be made, relating in particular to international treaties, acts of international organisations and of the European Communities, and to unwritten international law. This is the first time that such a comprehensive and detailed survey has been made of all thirteen countries. Reading the national reports one after the other provides complete information on domestic practices; reading them crosswise gives a direct comparison between the different countries on specificissues.",

This source portrays Jesus primarily as a healer and teller of parables, a portrayal very different from that of the suffering Son of Man in Mark, the aphoristic teacher of Wisdom in Q, or the depiction of Jesus as universal saviour that Luke himself prefers. This source is quite primitive, probably earlier than Mark, perhaps as early as Q, to which it is quite similar in form, if not content.",

This collection of essays by leading scholars of the period highlights the instrumental role he played in the shaping of the political, literary, and print cultures of the Restoration period. Taking an interdisciplinary approach the volume covers all the major aspects of his career, as well as situating them in their broader historical and literary context. By examining his career in this way the book offers insights that will prove of worth to political, social, religious and cultural historians, as well as those interested in seventeenth-century literary and book history.",

Pour la respecter, il faut s'affranchir des mythes qui l'entourent depuis un siècle et demi. C'est l'objet du premier chapitre. Ainsi sera-t-on ramené aux poèmes, à leur lettre irrémédiable. Au-delà, quatre chapitres examinent la récurrence d'un thème l'éternel, l'infini, la mer, la rue - quatre variantes d'une hantise du poète : le nombre. \" Tout est nombre. Le nombre est dans tout. Le nombre est dans l'individu. L'ivresse est un nombre \", lit-on dans Fusées. Le nombre: d'un côté l'ordre, la doctrine pythagoricienne donnant accès aux règles de l'univers ; de l'autre la discorde, la mer méchante, la rue passante. Ou encore le vers, \" rime et nombre \", comme le définit Baudelaire : rythme, cadence, harmonie, mais aussi débordement, démesure, dissonance. Deux chapitres reconduisent enfin le temps et l'allégorie, autres obsessions liées au nombre (\" - Ah ! ne jamais sortir des Nombres et des Etres ! \"), aux formes qui les portent : la syncope et le non sequitur qui cassent le vers des Fleurs du mal.",

Yet they remain irreconcilable and are mutually contradictory in a number of their elements and characteristics. Do Educational Sciences offer a scientific base or ideological support for New Education? Do the numerous new educational initiatives and reforms provide a -laboratory- for Educational Sciences or alternatives to the new scientific paradigms? Is this at the risk of their merging? And what is the price of these tensions? Specialists in the history of Educational Sciences and New Education from various geographical, cultural and disciplinary horizons explore the complex links between this powerful reforming movement and the nascent disciplinary field that emerged during the first half of the 20th century. Cet ouvrage analyse les relations tumultueuses - passionnelles meme - de l'Education nouvelle et des Sciences de l'education: un couple indissociable - intrinsequement lie et d'une etonnante fecondite - autant qu'inconciliable, nombre de leurs presupposes et caracteristiques se contredisant mutuellement. Les Sciences de l'education offrent-elles la base scientifique ou l'appui ideologique de l'Education nouvelle ? Les nombreuses experiences et reformes educatives constituent-elles des laboratoires des Sciences de l'education ou des alternatives aux nouveaux paradigmes scientifiques ? Au risque de leur fusion ? Au prix de quelles tensions ? Des specialistes de l'histoire des Sciences de l'education et de l'Education nouvelle d'horizons geographiques, culturels et disciplinaires divers explorent les rapports complexes entre ce puissant mouvement reformiste et le champ disciplinaire naissant durant la premiere moitie du 20e siecle.\"",

This ordered grouping of definitions will enlighten the reader about the priorities of the international community regarding environmental law. Definitions are classified in alphabetical order, in separate English and French lists. In each language there is an alphabetical list of common terms with the equivalent second language term in square brackets. The list gives the exact detailed meaning followed by the source of each term. Following this list, a lexicon of the same terms is given under such general themes as \"Mammals\", \"Gas\", \"Lead\".

La publication de tous ces arrêts et décisions représente plusieurs centaines de volumes, une abondance qui en rend la consultation parfois difficile. L'auteur de présent ouvrage - juriste - extrait l'essentiel de cette vaste jurisprudence pour la rassembler en un volume unique. En effet, celui-ci représente pour chaque article de la Convention, les passages clés d'arrêts de la Cour et de certaines décisions de la Commission, assortis de leurs commentaires. L'objectif est de fournir, en un seul document, le maximum de citations d'arrêts en une consultation concrète et directe. Ce livre offre ainsi un accès \"pédagogique\", synthétique et clair à la jurisprudence de la Cour du Conseil de l'Europe. Par ailleurs, une table des matières détaillée et un index donnent au lecteur différentes voies d'accès à cet ouvrage, qui devient ainsi un outil indispensable tant pour le néophyte que pour le spécialiste plus expérimenté de la Convention.",

            "description": "L’Intime épistolaire (1850-1900): genre et pratique culturelle is a study of private letters by eight Nineteenth-Century French authors—Flaubert, Zola, Sand, Baudelaire, Maupassant, Eberhardt, Bashkirtseff and Edmond de Goncourt—during the period of 1850 to 1900. Through in-depth analyses of these intriguing documents, the book demonstrates that personal correspondences cast fresh light on the concept of intimacy in Nineteenth-Century French culture. Since epistolary writing implies a necessary exchange between lived experience and the written word, the book’s intention is also to interpret “letter practice” as a specific textual form, with its own generic expectations and constraints which are distinct from other life-writing genres such as the diary, the autobiography, and the memoir. Divided into five chapters, the study begins with a short introduction to the “culture of individuality.” The four subsequent chapters explore the poetics of epistolary writing, including significant topics, the various roles of the letter writer, epistolary pacts and the problem of the signature. Addressing a wide range of epistolary situations, including daily life, health, money problems, love, travel, and even suicide notes, the book also offers new critical perspectives on six of the most interesting manuscript letters that have been chosen from the examined sources.",

This is the story of the establishment of a school of medicine that is part of a growing trend toward providing medical education that responds to the needs of remote populations and produces resourceful physicians capable of meeting those needs. Twelve contributors highlight the various aspects of the school's development and the unique opportunities it offers. The first new medical school in Canada in over thirty years, the Northern Ontario School of Medicine provides a blueprint for those interested in an innovative approach to medical education.

            "description": "Through the ages, the pursuit of Happiness has been at the heart of the needs and desires each individual would seek to fulfill, while as a concept, Happiness has always resonated strongly in poetic as well as philosophical, sociological and psychological contexts. But what about Happiness today, in a world dominated by technology, driven by productivity and dictated by efficiency? Does Happiness still feature in contemporary fiction in any significant way? Or has it perhaps gone underground, adopting different guises? Would we still call that “duty of happiness” that Pascal Bruckner saw as “present at the second half of the twentieth century” a relevant force today? Or has it waned perceptibly? The articles brought together in this volume seek to work out answers to these and similar questions, creatively addressing the imminent risks but also eagerly following up the intriguing possibilities one encounters when interrogating Happiness in the contemporary novel. Originally based on an international conference organized at the University of Haifa, Israel, in May 2010, the volume is structured around the axes we found useful as a basis for the various approaches towards Happiness in Europe and the historical and social events that influenced the writing of Happiness as they defined the 20th century and have impacted on the 21st: the Holocaust, the Soviet dystopia, consumerism, postmodernism, “everyday life,” the various as yet unarticulated new modes of life they have given rise to, and so on. A new writing of happiness then? At the very least this volume targets the contemporary novel without wanting to solidify works, instead taking into account the fluctuations Happiness has been subjected to, and the diversity and especially the paradoxes it has created, while we have been keen to preserve a “precise” reading of the texts and have felt compelled to respect and preserve the particular features that make the writings of the authors we focus on stand out. Thème philosophique aussi bien que poétique, sociologique et psychologique, le bonheur s’édifie à la mesure de chacun. « N’est-il pas vrai que, nous autres hommes, nous désirons tous être heureux ? » (Platon). Or dans notre monde actuel dominé par la technique, la recherche à outrance du productif et de l’efficacité, qu’en est-il du bonheur ? Est-il encore présent aux écritures romanesques contemporaines ? Sous quelles formes se présenterait sa recherche ? Ce « devoir de bonheur propre à la deuxième moitié du XXe siècle » dont parle Pascal Bruckner, continue-t-il toujours à être d’actualité ? S’est-il renforcé ou, au contraire, s’est-il affaibli? Le projet d’un questionnement du bonheur dans le roman contemporain comportait de gros risques, mais il offrait en même temps des possibilités stimulantes. A la suite du colloque international organisé à l’université de Haïfa en mai 2010, les textes réunis dans ce livre, cherchent à élaborer des éléments de réponse à ces questions. Le volume offre un état des lieux du bonheur dans le roman depuis 1980 et présente une large diversité d’approches, de définitions, d’interrogations sur l’écriture du bonheur sur trois décennies. Le recueil s’articule autour d’axes qui ont servi de base aux différentes approches du bonheur en Europe et d’événements historiques et sociaux qui ont pu influencer l’écriture du bonheur aux différentes périodes du XXe et XXe siècles, telles que l’Holocauste, la dystopie en Russie, le postmodernisme et le consumérisme, le quotidien, les différents paradoxes du bonheur, les nouveaux modes de vie. Nouvelle écriture du bonheur? Du moins, ce volume vise-t-il le contemporain sans figer les œuvres, tout en tenant compte des fluctuations du sujet, de sa diversité, de ses paradoxes surtout, tout en conservant la lecture précise des textes et en respectant la particularité de l’écriture des auteurs traités.",

            "description": "Several of the very foundations of the cosmological standard model — the baryon asymmetry of the universe, dark matter, and the origin of the hot big bang itself — still call for an explanation from the perspective of fundamental physics. This work advocates one intriguing possibility for a consistent cosmology that fills in the theoretical gaps while being fully in accordance with the observational data. At very high energies, the universe might have been in a false vacuum state that preserved B-L, the difference between the baryon number B and the lepton number L as a local symmetry. In this state, the universe experienced a stage of hybrid inflation that only ended when the false vacuum became unstable and decayed, in the course of a waterfall transition, into a phase with spontaneously broken B-L symmetry. This B-L Phase Transition was accompanied by tachyonic preheating that transferred almost the entire energy of the false vacuum into a gas of B-L Higgs bosons, which in turn decayed into heavy Majorana neutrinos. Eventually, these neutrinos decayed into massless radiation, thereby producing the entropy of the hot big bang, generating the baryon asymmetry of the universe via the leptogenesis mechanism and setting the stage for the production of dark matter. Next to a variety of conceptual novelties and phenomenological predictions, the main achievement of the thesis is hence the fascinating notion that the leading role in the first act of our universe might have actually been played by neutrinos.",

            "description": "Comedian. Icon. TV star. Role model. Trash talker. Fag hag. Gypsy. Tramp. Thief. Margaret Cho displays her numerous sides in this funny, fierce, and honest memoir. As one of the country’s most visible Asian Americans, she has a unique perspective on identity and acceptance. As one of the country’s funniest and most quoted personalities, she takes no prisoners. And as a warm and wise woman who has seen the highs and lows of life, she has words of encouragement for anyone who has ever felt like an outsider. With I’m the One That I Want, Margaret Cho has written a book every bit as hilarious, shocking, and insightful as she is. From the Trade Paperback edition.",

As the poor trade welfare checks for low-wage jobs, their low earnings qualify them for a hefty check come tax time—a combination of the earned income tax credit and other refunds. For many working parents this one check is like hitting the lottery, offering several months’ wages as well as the hope of investing in a better future. Drawing on interviews with 115 families, the authors look at how parents plan to use this annual cash windfall to build up savings, go back to school, and send their kids to college. However, these dreams of upward mobility are often dashed by the difficulty of trying to get by on meager wages. In accessible and engaging prose, It’s Not Like I’m Poor examines the costs and benefits of the new work-based safety net, suggesting ways to augment its strengths so that more of the working poor can realize the promise of a middle-class life.",

Russell (1864-1926) was also an accomplished author in the humorous genre known as \"local color.\" Raphael Cristy sorts Russell's writings into four general categories: serious Indian stories, men encountering wildlife, cattle range characters, and nineteenth-century westerners facing twentieth-century challenges. Russell's art is often misinterpreted as mere longing for a fading open-range west, but his writings tell a different story. Cristy shows how Russell amused his peers with stories that also delivered sharp observations of Euro-American suppression of Indians and humorous treatment of wilderness and range issues plus the emergence of women and urbanization as bewildering agents of change in the modern West. \"A welcome departure from the usual biographies and coffee table volumes on Russell and his art. . . . [Cristy] deals with an important, yet relatively unexplored, aspect of the career of one of the most influential interpreters of the American West.\"--Byron Price, Director, C. M.

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study. An episode listing--brief plot outline, casts and credits, air dates, and titles--is also provided.",

A unifying theme in this area is the quantisation of geometrical objects. The majority of contributions to this volume cover recent advances in superstring theory, which is the leading candidate for a unified description of all known elementary particles and interactions. The geometrical concept of one-dimensional extended objects (strings) has always been at the core of superstring theory, but recently the focus has shifted to include higher-dimensional objects (D-branes), which play a key role in non-perturbative dynamics of the theory. Related developments are also described in M-theory, our understanding of quantum effects in black-hole physics, gauge theory of the strong interaction, and the dynamic triangulation construction of the quantum geometry of spacetime.",

This is a course-tested comprehensive introductory graduate text on superstrings which stresses the most current areas of interest, not covered in other presentation, including: string field theory, multi loops, Teichmueller spaces, conformal field theory, and four-dimensional strings. The book begins with a simple discussion of point particle theory, and uses the Feynman path integral technique to unify the presentation of superstrings. Prerequisites are an aquaintance with quantum mechanics and relativity. This second edition has been revised and updated throughout.",

Topics covered include couplings of supergravity with matter, spontaneous symmetry breaking and the super-higgs effect, construction of supergravity unified models, and the phenomenon of SU(2) x U(1) electroweak-symmetry breaking by supergravity. Experimental consequences of N-1 supergravity unified theory, in particular, the possible supersymmetric decays of the W± and Z0 bosons, are also discussed. The treatment presented encompasses a broad class of models, both of the tree breaking as well as the radiative breaking of SU(2) x U(1). Rules of tensor calculus and the explicit construction of the Lagrangian of the Supergravity-matter couplings are given in the appendix.",

Unlike any other noun class, the n-stems have roots that are characterized by systematic consonant and vowel alternations across the different Germanic dialects. This monograph represents a diachronic investigation of this root variation. It traces back the Germanic n-stems to their Indo-European origin, and clarifies their formal characteristics by an interaction of sound law and analogy. This book therefore is not just an attempt to account for the typology of the Germanic n-stems, but also a case study of the impact that sound change may have on the evolution of morphology and derivation.",

Little wonder, for readers are immediately drawn to Kent's vivid descriptions of the experience; we share \"the feeling of wind and wet and cold, of lifting seas and steep descents, of rolling over as the wind gusts hit,\" and the sound \"of wind in the shrouds, of hard spray flung on a drum-tight canvas, of rushing water at the scuppers, of the gale shearing a tormented sea.\" When the ship sinks in a storm-swept fjord within 50 miles of its destination, the story turns to the stranding and subsequent rescue of the three-man crew, salvage of the vessel, and life among native Greenlanders. Magnificently illustrated by Kent's wood-block prints and narrated in his poetic and highly entertaining style, this tale of the perils of killer nor'easters, treacherous icebergs, and impenetrable fog -- and the joys of sperm whales breaching or dawn unmasking a longed-for landfall -- is a rare treat for old salts and landlubbers alike.",

It presents an up-to-date picture of this phenomenon, characterising its major attributes and addressing neighbouring theoretical concepts like \"availability, profitability\" or \"lexicalisation.\" Links are also established between those notions and N+N compounding, a word-formation process regarded as very productive but traditionally overlooked in studies of this type. Unlike other productivity surveys, mostly directed at affixation, a corpus of N+N compounds is here compiled to which the mainstream models of productivity are applied. This allows to detect the pros and cons of those proposals and to propose a model of productivity. Two measures, \"Indicator of Profitability\" (π) and \"Trend of Profitability\" (Π), are introduced which can be applied across word-formation processes and are able to compute their productivity based on semantic categories.",

This 2006 book provides an entirely self-contained introduction to the theory of L-functions in a style accessible to graduate students with a basic knowledge of classical analysis, complex variable theory, and algebra. Also within the volume are many new results not yet found in the literature. The exposition provides complete detailed proofs of results in an easy-to-read format using many examples and without the need to know and remember many complex definitions. The main themes of the book are first worked out for GL(2,R) and GL(3,R), and then for the general case of GL(n,R). In an appendix to the book, a set of Mathematica functions is presented, designed to allow the reader to explore the theory from a computational point of view.",

            "description": "When his first novel House Made of Dawn was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1969, N. Scott Momaday was virtually unknown. Today he is the most acclaimed Native American writer, working at the peak of his creative power and gaining stature also as an important painter. His first retrospective was held in 1993 at the Wheel-wright Museum in Santa Fe. The son of a Kiowa artist and a Cherokee-Anglo mother, Momaday synthesizes multiple cultural influences in his writing and painting. While much of his attention focuses on the difficult task of reconciling ancient traditions with modern reality, his work itself is an example of how the best of the Indian and non-Indian worlds can be arranged into a startling mosaic of seemingly contradictory cultural and artistic elements. Momaday sees his writings as one long, continuous story, a working out of his evolving identity as a modern Kiowa. It is a story grounded in the oral tradition of his ancestors and told in the modes of the traditional storyteller and the modern novelist-poet who is steeped in the best writings of American and European literature. The interviews in this volume span the period from 1970 to 1993. Momaday responds candidly to questions relating to his multicultural background, his views on the place of the Indian in American literature and society, his concern for conservation and an American land ethic, his theory of language and the imagination, the influences on his artistic and academic development, and his comments on specific works he has written. The reader who joins these conversations will meet in N. Scott Momaday a careful listener and an engaging, often humorous speaker whose commentaries provide a deeper vision for those interested in his life and work.",

The first IAU conference [IJ, six years ago, was motivated by the renaissance in Celestial Mechanics following the launching of artificial earth satellites, and was an attempt to bring to bear on the problems of Stellar Dynamics the sophisticated analytical techniques of Celestial Mechanics. That meeting was an outgrowth of the 'Summer Institutes in Celestial Mechanics' initiated by Dirk Brouwer. By the second IAU conference [2J, our interest had been captured by the attempts to simulate stellar systems on the computer. Computer simulation is now an essential part of stellar dynamics; journals of computational physics have started in the United Kingdom and in the United States and symposia on computer simulation of many-body problems have become a perennial event [3,4, 5]. Although our early hopes that the computer would 'solve' our problem have been tempered by experience, some techniques of computer simulation have now matured through five years of testing and use. A working description of the six most popular methods is appended to this volume. During the past three years, stellar dynamicists have followed closely the develop ments in the related field of Plasma Physics. The contexts of Plasma and Stellar Physics are deceptively similar; at first, results from Plasma Physics were bodily transferred to stellar systems by 'changing the sign of the coupling'. We are more sophisticated and more skeptical now.",

An explosion in the use of NHCs has been reported in the literature during the past seven years making this comprehensive overview highly apropos. The book begins with an introductory overview of NHCs which could have been subtitled all you need to know about NHCs. The main body of the book is dedicated to applications of NHCs in catalysis. In addition to the success stories of NHCs in metathesis, NHCs in cross coupling and more recently NHCs in organocatalysis, all other less publicized areas are also covered. As the success of NHCs is generally attributed to their potential to stabilize metal centres, the inclusion of a chapter on the decomposition of NHC catalysts is pertinent. The book closes with a chapter describing the applications of NHCs in industrial processes, which is the first coverage of its kind, and brings a unique industrial context to this book. Included in this book: Historical aspects of NHCs Synthetic pathways to NHC precursors, free NHCs and complexes Methods of characterisation of NHCs and related complexes Electronic properties of NHCs Steric properties of NHCs and models for their description NHCs for metathesis and cross-coupling reactions NHCs as organocatalysts NHC Transition-Metal mediated oxidations, additions to multiple bonds, polymerisation and oligomerisation, cyclisations, direct arylations, reactions involving CO, C-F and C-H bond activation, ... Decomposition of NHC-containing catalysts Industrial applications involving NHC-containing catalysts N-Heterocyclic Carbenes in Transition Metal Catalysis and Organocatalysis provides a fresh view of NHCs since most contributors are young emerging researchers in the field of homogeneous catalysis using NHCs. This group of contributors is complemented by highly established academic researchers and an industrialist. This book is comprehensive, from the basic features of NHCs to the latest advances, hence it is suitable for both the novice and the expert.",

Beginning with the K\u0084hler structure of D=4 supergravity Lagrangians, through the analysis of string compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds, one reaches the heart of the matter with the chiral ring structure of N=2 conformal field theories and its relation to topological field theory models and Landau-Ginzburg models. In addition, mirror symmetry, topological twists and Picard-Fuchs equations are discussed.",

Previous workshops of the series on N* Physics took place at the Florida State University (1994), at CEBAF (1995), at the Institute for Nuclear Theory in Seattle (1996) and at the George Washington University (1997). The Workshop was devoted to a summary of recent experimental and the oretical research on N* phsyics and special emphasis was given to the infor mation that photo-and electro-production of nucleon resonances can provide on the non-perturbative regime of Quantum Chromodynamics. The idea was to stimulate discussions among experimentalists and theoreticians in order to pursue the interpretation of the huge amount of forthcoming data from several laboratories in the world. It was therefore decided to have both experimental and theoretical lectures on the main topics, like ,among the others, single and double pion production, TJ-and K-meson production, the GDH sum rule, the spin of the proton, etc. Thanks to the unusual two-week extension of the Work shop, the allotted time for the lectures was extended up to one hour in order to allow the invited lecturers to give a detailed presentation of their topics. Fi nally, various short contributions were selected to sharpen the discussion about selected items.",

After waking up from a vicious attack with no memory of who he is or the life he has led, James “The Hammer” Maal has to work to piece together the details of his life, along with trying to solve the mystery of who attacked him and why. With the help of his wife, Diane, their family, and some ‘native’ friends, memories are triggered. However, as he begins to remember bits and pieces of his life, and gets closer to the truth of his attack, Jim and all of his loved ones start to come under fire, literally. When Jim’s investigation leads him to the name ‘Castle,’ his life, and the lives of everyone around him are never the same again.",

Much of the tension that drives O’Connor’s writing, says Sarah Gordon, stems from the natural resistance of her imagination to the obedience expected by her male-centered church, society, and literary background. Flannery O’Connor: The Obedient Imagination shows us a writer whose world was steeped in male presumption regarding women and creativity. The book is filled with fresh perspectives on O’Connor’s Catholicism; her upbringing as a dutiful, upper-class southern daughter; her readings of Thurber, Poe, Eliot, and other arguably misogynistic authors; and her schooling in the New Criticism. As Gordon leads us through a world premised on expectations at odds with O’Connor’s strong and original imagination, she ranges across all of O’Connor’s fiction and many of her letters and essays. While acknowledging O’Connor’s singular situation, Gordon also gleans insights from the lives and works of other southern writers, Eudora Welty, Caroline Gordon, and Margaret Mitchell among them. Flannery O’Connor: The Obedient Imagination draws on Sarah Gordon’s thirty years of reading, teaching, and discussing one of our most complex and influential authors. It takes us closer than we have ever been to the creative struggles behind such literary masterpieces as Wise Blood and “A Good Man Is Hard to Find.”",

But barely two years later the four friends succumbed to a rift so deep that three of them stopped showing up for sold-out shows. Lead singer Omari Grandberry was left with the intimidating prospect of facing their fans alone. In this intimate memoir, Omarion chronicles his Los Angeles childhood, how B2K came together, the ups and downs of instant brotherhood, the struggles of making it in entertainment, what really happened in the final days of B2K, and what's next for him -- including starring in the Fat Albert movie, and more. Here is the story of a boy with the gift of song and dance raised in some of L.A.'s toughest neighborhoods, and how he ditched his \"underage thug\" complex to pursue his dream. Along the way, Omarion shares a more personal side, including his deep respect for the women who raised him and the roots of his spiritual foundation. In O, he once again takes center stage, revealing himself to be a thoughtful, funny, multifaceted artist with the talent and drive to make it on his own.",

            "description": "In any age, humans wrestle with apparently inexorable forces. Today, we face the threat of global terrorism. In the aftermath of September 11, few could miss sensing that a great evil was at work in the world. In Flannery O’Connor’s time, the threats came from different sources—World War II, the Cold War, and the Korean conflict—but they were just as real. She, too, lived though a “time of terror.” The first major critical volume on Flannery O’Connor’s work in more than a decade, Flannery O’Connor in the Age of Terrorism explores issues of violence, evil, and terror—themes that were never far from O’Connor’s reach and that seem particularly relevant to our present-day setting. The fifteen essays collected here offer a wide range of perspectives that explore our changing views of violence in a post-9/11 world and inform our understanding of a writer whose fiction abounds in violence. Written by both established and emerging scholars, the pieces that editors Avis Hewitt and Robert Donahoo have selected offer a compelling and varied picture of this iconic author and her work. Included are comparisons of O’Connor to 1950s writers of noir literature and to the contemporary American novelist Cormac McCarthy; cultural studies that draw on horror comics of the Cold War and on Fordism and the American mythos of the automobile; and pieces that shed new light on O’Connor’s complex religious sensibility and its role in her work. While continuing to speak fresh truths about her own time, O’Connor’s fiction also resonates deeply with the postmodern sensibilities of audiences increasingly distant from her era—readers absorbed in their own terrors and sense of looming, ineffable threats. This provocative new collection presents O’Connor’s work as a touchstone for understanding where our culture has been and where we are now. With its diverse approaches, Flannery O’Connor in the Age of Terrorism will prove useful not only to scholars and students of literature but to anyone interested in history, popular culture, theology, and reflective writing. Avis Hewitt has published articles in Flannery O’Connor Review, Christianity and Literature, and Renascence. She is associate professor of English at Grand Valley State University in Allendale, Michigan. Robert Donahoo is professor of English at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. He has published articles in Flannery O’Connor Review, Literature and Belief, Journal of Contemporary Thought, and Journal of the Short Story in English.",

The essays offer both new directions for, and new insights into, reading O'Connor's fiction. Some essays probe issues that, until recently, had been ignored. Others reshape long-standing debates in light of new critical insights from gender studies, rhetorical theory, dialogism, and psychoanalysis. Topics discussed include O'Connor's early stories, her canonical status, the phenomenon of doubling, the feminist undertones of her stories' grotesqueries, and her self-denial in life and art. Commentary on O'Connor has most often centered on her regional realism and the poetics of her Catholicism. By regarding O'Connor as a major American writer and focusing on the variety of critical approaches that might be taken to her work, these essays dispel the earlier geographic and religious stereotypes and point out new avenues of study.",

            "description": "In the face of seemingly relentless American optimism, Eugene O'Neill's plays reveal an America many would like to ignore, a place of seething resentments, aching desires, and family tragedy, where failure and disappointment are the norm and the American dream a chimera. Though derided by critics during his lifetime, his works resonated with audiences, won him the Nobel Prize and four Pulitzer, and continue to grip theatergoers today. Now noted historian John Patrick Diggins offers a masterly biography that both traces O'Neill's tumultuous life and explains the forceful ideas that form the heart of his unflinching works. Diggins paints a richly detailed portrait of the playwright's life, from his Irish roots and his early years at sea to his relationships with his troubled mother and brother. Here we see O'Neill as a young Greenwich Village radical, a ravenous autodidact who attempted to understand the disjunction between the sunny public face of American life and the rage that he knew was simmering beneath. According to Diggins, O'Neill mined this disjunction like no other American writer. His characters burn with longing for an idealized future composed of equal parts material success and individual freedom, but repeatedly they fall back to earth, pulled by the tendrils of family and the insatiability of desire. Drawing on thinkers from Emerson to Nietzsche, O'Neill viewed this endlessly frustrated desire as the problematic core of American democracy, simultaneously driving and undermining American ideals of progress, success, and individual freedom. Melding a penetrating assessment of O'Neill's works and thought with a sensitive re-creation of his life, Eugene O'Neill's America offers a striking new view of America's greatest playwright - and a new picture of American democracy itself.",

            "description": "In her short life, the prolific Flannery O'Connor (1925-1964) authored two novels, thirty-two stories, and numerous essays and articles. Although her importance as a twentieth-century southern writer is unquestionable, mainstream feminist criticism has generally neglected O'Connor's work. In Revising Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Hemple Prown addresses the conflicts O'Connor experienced as a \"southern lady\" and professional author. Placing gender at the center of her analytical framework, Prown considers the reasons for feminist critical neglect of the writer and traces the cultural origins of the complicated aesthetic that informs O'Connor's fiction, both published and unpublished. O'Connor's relationship with her mentor Caroline Gordon, and its eventual disintegration, played a significant role in her development. As Prown shows, it underlines the shift from the relatively \"feminine\" authorial voice of O'Connor's earliest drafts toward the decidedly masculinized tone of her final, published works. Incorporating an insightful examination of the author in relation to the Fugitive/Agrarian and New Critical movements, Prown provides an original exploration of O'Connor's changing gender perspectives.",

Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four largecategories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automaticallycompressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. Java I/O, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software. Java I/O, 2nd Edition includes: Coverage of all I/O classes and related classes In-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets",

O'Connor's close study of these and other religious writers, such as Teilhard de Chardin, led her to bring forth in her fiction competing visions of world apocalypse and of a renewed religious community in the world.",

            "description": "The work of Frank O'Hara (1926–66) is central to any consideration of twentieth-century American poetry. Frank O'Hara Now, the first collection of essays to be dedicated to O'Hara in nearly two decades, asks why O'Hara remains so important to twenty-first-century readers and writers of poetry. For many, O'Hara's distinctive appeal depends on his witty depictions of urban experience, his relationship to the painters of abstract expressionism, and the exhilarating immediacy of his poetic voice. Yet these approachable qualities coexist with a demanding engagement with currents in European and American modernism. The book includes coverage of O'Hara moods that have rarely been discussed in the criticism to date, including boredom, hatred, and nihilism. Throughout, there is a powerful sense that fresh readings of O'Hara are crucial to understanding his continuing influence, making it essential reading for scholars and students of American poetry.",

Yet, we have very limited research and understanding of their sexualities. Instead, stereotypical images flourish even though scholars have challenged the validity and narrowness of these images and the lack of attention to the larger social context. Gathering the latest empirical work in the social and behavioral sciences, this reader offers us a critical lens through which to understand these images and the social context framing Latina/os and their sexualities. Situated at the juncture of Latina/o studies and sexualities studies, Latina/o Sexualities provides a single resource that addresses the current state of knowledge from a multidisciplinary perspective. Contributors synthesize and critique the literature and carve a separate space where issues of Latina/o sexualities can be explored given the limitations of prevalent research models. This work compels the current wave in sexuality studies to be more inclusive of ethnic minorities and sets an agenda that policy makers and researchers will find invaluable.",

O'Connor's curiosity about human nature and its various manifestations compelled her to explore mysterious places in the mind and heart. Despite her short life and prolonged illness, O'Connor was interviewed in a variety of times and locations. The circumstances of the interviews did not seem to matter much to O'Connor; her approach and demeanor remained consistent. Her self-knowledge was always apparent, in her confidence in herself, in her enterprise as a writer, and in her beliefs. She could penetrate the surfaces; she could see things in depth. Her perceptions were wide-ranging and insightful. Her interviews, given sparingly but with careful reflection and precision, make a unique contribution to an understanding of her fiction and to the evolving narrative of her short but influential life.

Focusing on stories with artist figures, objets d'art, child protagonists, and embodied images, Lake describes how O'Connor's fiction actively resisted romantic theories of the imagination and religious life by highlighting the epistemological necessity of the body. Ultimately O'Connor challenges the romantic and modern notion of the artist as a fire-stealing Prometheus and replaces it with a notion of the artist as a locally committed craftsman. Drawing upon M. M. Bakhtin's early essays in Art and Answerability and Toward a Philosophy of the Act, Lake illustrates O'Connor's conviction that art deliberately assigns the highest value of transcendental beauty to those beings least valued by the modern world, and challenges us to do the same. The book culminates with an original reading of Parker's Back that shows how in art, as in life, true knowledge comes to us through our own grotesque bodies and those of others. Unafraid of the mystery of being human, art can be the place where we encounter anew the world as more than what the intellect can unravel.",

Thus from one point of view, to study a pro-p group is the same as studying an infinite family of finite groups; but a pro-p group is also a compact topological group, and the compactness works its usual magic to bring 'infinite' problems down to manageable proportions. The p-adic integers appeared about a century ago, but the systematic study of pro-p groups in general is a fairly recent development. Although much has been dis covered, many avenues remain to be explored; the purpose of this book is to present a coherent account of the considerable achievements of the last several years, and to point the way forward. Thus our aim is both to stimulate research and to provide the comprehensive background on which that research must be based. The chapters cover a wide range. In order to ensure the most authoritative account, we have arranged for each chapter to be written by a leading contributor (or contributors) to the topic in question. Pro-p groups appear in several different, though sometimes overlapping, contexts.",

Steeped in music, dance, theater, and pageantry, but centrally focused on rhythm, such ensembles have been an integral part of village life in South Korea for centuries, serving as a musical accompaniment in the often overlapping and shifting contexts of labor, ritual, and entertainment. The first book to introduce Korean drumming and dance to the English-speaking world, Nathan Hesselink’s P’ungmul offers detailed descriptions of its instrumentation, dance formations, costuming, actors, teaching lineages, and the complexities of training. Hesselink also evaluates how this tradition has taken on new roles and meanings in the twentieth and early-twenty-first centuries, investigating the interrelated yet contested spheres of history, memory, government policy, grassroots politics, opportunities for musical transmission, and performance practices and aesthetics. P’ungmul offers those interested in ethnomusicology, world music, anthropology, sociology, and Asian studies a special glimpse into the inner workings of a historically rich, artistically complex, and aesthetically and aurally beautiful Korean musical and dance tradition.",

For most people it's a shorthand way of deciding how highly the market regards a company, with investors prepared to overpay for earnings from a high-P/E 'glamour' stock as opposed to a low-P/E 'value' stock. However, academics have known since 1960 that the opposite is true: value stocks outperform glamour stocks consistently over decades. A company with a low P/E may have been marked down for no readily apparent reason and thus could represent an attractive value investment for those with the patience to wait while the market re-values it. However, the P/E is a backward-looking measure and just because the company earned 1 per share last year it doesn't necessarily mean it will earn anything like that in the foreseeable future. Or, a low P/E can mean a company is deservedly cheap because it is in financial difficulty - in this case the company is likely to become cheaper yet or even go into administration. This book is a practical guide to how you can adjust and improve the price-earnings ratio and use it, alongside other financial ratios, to run against the crowd and boost your stock returns.\"",

            "description": "In exploration seismology, data are acquired at multiple source and receiver posi tions along a profile line. These data are subsequently processed and interpreted. The primary result of this process is a subsurface image of the exploration target. As part of this procedure, additional information is also obtained about the subsurface material properties, e.g., seismic velocities. The methods that are employed in the acquisition and processing of exploration seismic data are internally consistent. That is, principally near vertical incidence seismic waves are generated, recorded and subsequently imaged. The data processing methods commonly used are based upon a small angle of incidence approximation, thus making the imaging problem tractable for existing data processing technology. Although tremendously successful, the limitations of this method are generally recognized. Current and future exploration goals will likely require the use of additional seismic waves, i.e., both compressional and shear precritical and postcritical reflections and refractions. Also, in addition to making better use of seismic travel times, recent efforts to directly incorporate seismic amplitude variations show that the approach may lead to a better understanding of subsurface rock properties. In response to more demanding exploration goals, recent data acquisition techniques have improved significantly by increasing the spatial aperture and incorporating a large number of closely spaced receivers. The need for better subsurface resolution in depth and position has encouraged the use of 240, 512, and even 1024 recorded data channels with receiver separations of 5 to 25 m.",

Notebooks P and Q span the period from the first public announcement of photography in 1839 through the 1843 plateau of Talbot's researches. They record both his false starts and his triumphs. While the emphasis is on the new art of photography, there is substantial reference to chemistry, electricity, light, optics, and railroad motive power. The notebook pages are reproduced in full, preserving the tempo and organization of Talbot's thoughts, and keeping his sketches in context. This book will fascinate anyone interested in the history of science or technology.",

These exotic numbers (or so they appeared at first) are now well-established in the mathematical world and used more and more by physicists as well. This book offers a self-contained presentation of basic p-adic analysis. The author is especially interested in the analytical topics in this field. Some of the features which are not treated in other introductory p-adic analysis texts are topological models of p-adic spaces inside Euclidean space, a construction of spherically complete fields, a p-adic mean value theorem and some consequences, a special case of Hazewinkel's functional equation lemma, a remainder formula for the Mahler expansion, and most importantly a treatment of analytic elements.",

However, transformer talent is at a premium today, and all aspects of the power industry are suffering a diminishing of the supply of knowledgeable and experienced engineers. Now in print for over 80 years since initial publication in 1925 by Johnson & Phillips Ltd, the J & P Transformer Book continues to withstand the test of time as a key body of reference material for students, teachers, and all whose careers are involved in the engineering processes associated with power delivery, and particularly with transformer design, manufacture, testing, procurement, application, operation, maintenance, condition assessment and life extension. Current experience and knowledge have been brought into this thirteenth edition with discussions on moisture equilibrium in the insulation system, vegetable based natural ester insulating fluids, industry concerns with corrosive sulphur in oil, geomagnetic induced current (GIC) impacts, transportation issues, new emphasis on measurement of load related noise, and enhanced treatment of dielectric testing (including Frequency Response Analysis), Dissolved Gas analysis (DGA) techniques and tools, vacuum LTCs, shunt and series reactors, and HVDC converter transformers. These changes in the thirteenth edition together with updates of IEC reference Standards documentation and inclusion for the first time of IEEE reference Standards, provide recognition that the transformer industry and market is truly global in scale. -- From the foreword by Donald J. Fallon Martin Heathcote is a consultant specializing in power transformers, primarily working for utilities. In this context he has established working relationships with transformer manufacturers on several continents. His background with Ferranti and the UK’s Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) included transformer design and the management and maintenance of transformer-based systems. * The definitive reference for all involved in designing, installing, monitoring and maintaining high-voltage systems using power transformers (electricity generation and distribution sector; large-scale industrial applications) * The classic reference work on power transformers and their applications: first published in 1925, now brought fully up to date in this thirteenth edition * A truly practical engineering approach to design, monitoring and maintenance of power transformers – in electricity generation, substations, and industrial applications.",

Professor Iwasawa reviews the classical results on Dirichlet's L-functions and sketches a proof for some of them. Next he defines generalized Bernoulli numbers and discusses some of their fundamental properties. Continuing, he defines p-adic L-functions, proves their existence and uniqueness, and treats p-adic logarithms and p-adic regulators. He proves a formula of Leopoldt for the values of p-adic L-functions at s=1. The formula was announced in 1964, but a proof has never before been published. Finally, he discusses some applications, especially the strong relationship with cyclotomic fields.",

This work, known primarily for its erotic realism, is also a landmark in the development of narrative art--not only from a specifically Chinese perspective but in a world-historical context. With the possible exception of The Tale of Genji (1010) and Don Quixote (1615), there is no earlier work of prose fiction of equal sophistication in world literature. Although its importance in the history of Chinese narrative has long been recognized, the technical virtuosity of the author, which is more reminiscent of the Dickens of Bleak House, the Joyce of Ulysses, or the Nabokov of Lolita than anything in the earlier Chinese fiction tradition, has not yet received adequate recognition. This is partly because all of the existing European translations are either abridged or based on an inferior recension of the text. This translation and its annotation aim to faithfully represent and elucidate all the rhetorical features of the original in its most authentic form and thereby enable the Western reader to appreciate this Chinese masterpiece at its true worth.",

            "description": "Traditionally, $p$-adic $L$-functions have been constructed from complex $L$-functions via special values and Iwasawa theory. In this volume, Perrin-Riou presents a theory of $p$-adic $L$-functions coming directly from $p$-adic Galois representations (or, more generally, from motives). This theory encompasses, in particular, a construction of the module of $p$-adic $L$-functions via the arithmetic theory and a conjectural definition of the $p$-adic $L$-function via its special values. Since the original publication of this book in French (see Asterisque 229, 1995), the field has undergone significant progress. These advances are noted in this English edition. Also, some minor improvements have been made to the text.",

Crick had a specific project in mind when they offered Sidney Altman a position in their group in 1969 to conduct postdoctoral research at the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Biology (LMB) in Cambridge, England. At the time, an intense international competition was on- ing in as many as a dozen labs to determine the three-dimensional structure of tRNA. At the LMB, Aaron Klug was attacking the structure by crystallographic analysis with Brian F. C. Clark providing large amounts of purified phenylalanine tRNA. (Eventually, Aaron announced his empirically determined 3-D structure of yeast phenylalanine tRNA, a structure that is generally common to tRNAs, due in part to several conserved, novel three-way nucleotide interactions. ) Concurrently, Michael Levitt, a Ph. D. student of Francis, was visually scrutinizing the cloverleaf secondary structure of the 14 tRNA sequences known at the time. Levitt was searching for nucleotide covariation in different parts of the molecules that were conserved in the 14 sequences known at the time. He identified a possible covariation of an apparent Watson-Crick pairing type between the residues at position 15 from the 5’ end of the tRNA and residue 48. This association implied these parts of the tRNA, namely the D loop containing residue 15 and the 5’ end of the T stem-adjoining residue 48, folded on one another in a tertiary structure shared by different tRNAs.",

An elementary construction of Shimura varieties as moduli of abelian schemes. 2. p-adic deformation theory of automorphic forms on Shimura varieties. 3. A simple proof of irreducibility of the generalized Igusa tower over the Shimura variety. The book starts with a detailed study of elliptic and Hilbert modular forms and reaches to the forefront of research of Shimura varieties associated with general classical groups. The method of constructing p-adic analytic families and the proof of irreducibility was recently discovered by the author. The area covered in this book is now a focal point of research worldwide with many far-reaching applications that have led to solutions of longstanding problems and conjectures. Specifically, the use of p-adic elliptic and Hilbert modular forms have proven essential in recent breakthroughs in number theory (for example, the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem and the Shimura-Taniyama conjecture by A. Wiles and others). Haruzo Hida is Professor of Mathematics at University of California, Los Angeles. His previous books include Modular Forms and Galois Cohomology (Cambridge University Press 2000) and Geometric Modular Forms and Elliptic Curves (World Scientific Publishing Company 2000).",

            "description": "The representation theory of Lie groups plays a central role in both clas sical and recent developments in many parts of mathematics and physics. In August, 1995, the Fifth Workshop on Representation Theory of Lie Groups and its Applications took place at the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba in Argentina. Organized by Joseph Wolf, Nolan Wallach, Roberto Miatello, Juan Tirao, and Jorge Vargas, the workshop offered expository courses on current research, and individual lectures on more specialized topics. The present vol ume reflects the dual character of the workshop. Many of the articles will be accessible to graduate students and others entering the field. Here is a rough outline of the mathematical content. (The editors beg the indulgence of the readers for any lapses in this preface in the high standards of historical and mathematical accuracy that were imposed on the authors of the articles. ) Connections between flag varieties and representation theory for real re ductive groups have been studied for almost fifty years, from the work of Gelfand and Naimark on principal series representations to that of Beilinson and Bernstein on localization. The article of Wolf provides a detailed introduc tion to the analytic side of these developments. He describes the construction of standard tempered representations in terms of square-integrable partially harmonic forms (on certain real group orbits on a flag variety), and outlines the ingredients in the Plancherel formula. Finally, he describes recent work on the complex geometry of real group orbits on partial flag varieties.",

It also provides adequate preliminaries regarding computational problems and computational models. The P versus NP Question asks whether or not finding solutions is harder than checking the correctness of solutions. An alternative formulation asks whether or not discovering proofs is harder than verifying their correctness. It is widely believed that the answer to these equivalent formulations is positive, and this is captured by saying that P is different from NP. Although the P versus NP Question remains unresolved, the theory of NP-completeness offers evidence for the intractability of specific problems in NP by showing that they are universal for the entire class. Amazingly enough, NP-complete problems exist, and furthermore hundreds of natural computational problems arising in many different areas of mathematics and science are NP-complete.",

            "description": "Musician, composer, producer, arranger, and pioneering entrepreneur Quincy Jones has lived large and worked for five decades alongside the superstars of music and entertainment -- including Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, Steven Spielberg, Oprah Winfrey, Ray Charles, Will Smith, and dozens of others. Q is his glittering and moving life story, told with the style, passion, and no-holds-barred honesty that are his trademarks. Quincy Jones grew up poor on the mean streets of Chicago’s South Side, brushing against the law and feeling the pain of his mother’s descent into madness. But when his father moved the family west to Seattle, he took up the trumpet and was literally saved by music. A prodigy, he played backup for Billie Holiday and toured the world with the Lionel Hampton Band before leaving his teens. Soon, though, he found his true calling, inaugurating a career whose highlights have included arranging albums for Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, and Count Basie; composing the scores of such films as The Pawnbroker, In Cold Blood, In the Heat of the Night, and The Color Purple, and the theme songs for the television shows Ironside, Sanford and Son, and The Cosby Show; producing the bestselling album of all time, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, and the bestselling single “We Are the World”; and producing and arranging his own highly praised albums, including the Grammy Award—winning Back on the Block, a striking blend of jazz, African, urban, gospel, and hip-hop. His musical achievements, in a career that spans every style of American popular music, have yielded an incredible seventy-seven Grammy nominations, and are matched by his record as a pioneering music executive, film and television producer, tireless social activist, and business entrepreneur–one of the most successful black business figures in America. This string of unbroken triumphs in the entertainment industry has been shadowed by a turbulent personal life, a story he shares with eloquence and candor. Q is an impressive self-portrait by one of the master makers of American culture, a complex, many-faceted man with far more than his share of talents and an unparalleled vision, as well as some entirely human flaws. It also features vivid testimony from key witnesses to his journey–family, friends, and musical and business associates. His life encompasses an astonishing cast of show business giants, and provides the raw material for one of the great African American success stories of this century. From the Hardcover edition.",

The authors represent the contemporary state of the scholarly discussion in Europe and North America on the sayings source Q, in connection to actual problems of the quest of the historical Jesus. The contributions show different positions on the historical and exegetical problems though almost all of them are accepting the Q-hypothesis. Some of the articles are devoted to the text and theology of the Q-source (or Q-gospel) as a whole, others deal with more special questions of the language, or the historical background or context, or the situation of the Q-community. Some of the contributions give interpretations of important particular text-passages, including parables and miracle-stories. The volume gives a good overview of the progress of the discussion and research on Q since the Leuven colloquium in 1981.",

Set in the time of tremendous religious and political upheaval caused by the Reformation in Europe,Qbegins with Luther nailing his 95 theses on the door of the Wittenberg cathedral -- a historical flash point which would completely disrupt European society. The novel traces the adventures and conflicts of two central characters as they travel across Germany, Italy and the Netherlands. One is an Anabaptist, a member of the most radical Protestant sect. These are the anarchists of the Reformation who revolted against Catholicism and the emerging Reformation church. The other is a Catholic spy and informer. Like the leaders of religious reform, the book’s authors break with tradition -- seeking anonymity behind the pseudonym Luther Blissett. They have successfully created a world of intrigue, violence and intense political and religious passion. A phenomenal bestseller in Italy and Holland –Qis now being translated into eight languages. When it was first published anonymously in Italy, it was widely rumoured to be the work of Umberto Eco.",

It reveals detailed information pertaining to the basic science aspects of the interaction of Coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of Q (Query) fever, with the host and the immune response of the host to this unique pathogen. This one-of-a-kind work uses the rules of epidemiological evidence to determine whether or not Coxiella burnetii is a perinatal pathogen for man. This interesting, easy-to-understand text concludes with chapters dealing with the antibiotic susceptibility of Coxiella burnetii and the studies that resulted in a vaccine that now can be used to prevent this infection. This volume is an absolute must for all microbiologists, respirologists, infectious disease physicians and veterinarians.",

            "description": "The history of quantum theory is a maze of conceptual problems. In this lucid and learned book, Olivier Darrigol tracks the role of formal analogies between classical and quantum theory, from Planck's first introduction of the quantum of action to Dirac's formulation of quantum mechanics. In so doing, Darrigol illuminates not only the history of quantum theory but also the role of analogies in scientific thinking and theory change. The most remarkable result of such analogical argument in quantum theory was Bohr's correspondence principle which, in Darrigol's words, \"performed the acrobatic task of bridging two mutually contradictory theories (classical electrodynamics and atomic theory), without diminishing the contrast between them\". By analyzing the origins, development, and applications of this principle, From c-Numbers to q-Numbers explains the remarkable fruitfulness of the research done under Bohr's guidance between 1916 and 1925 and shows why Heisenberg claimed that quantum mechanics was born as \"a quantitative formulation of the correspondence principle\". With a physicist's sure hand, Darrigol examines the formal and the epistemological aspects of the analogy between classical and quantum mechanics. Unlike previous works, which have tended to focus on qualitative, global arguments, he follows the lines of mathematical reasoning and symbolizing, and by doing so he is able to show the motivations of early quantum theorists more precisely - and provocatively - than ever before. For instance, Darrigol demonstrates that a universal principle of elementary chaos underlay Planck's analogies, and that Bohr's correspondence principle was related to his elaboration of a minimal-quantumtheoretical language. Most striking, Darrigol reveals how Dirac's personal conception of the relations among algebra, geometry, use of the analogy between c-numbers and and physics conditioned his highly creative q-numbers. Original, erudite, and witty, From c-Numbers to q-Numbers sets a new standard for the philosophically perceptive and mathematically precise history of quantum mechanics. For years to come it will influence historical and philosophical discussions of twentieth-century physics.",

The writers, activists, essayists, and artists who contribute to this volume consider how Asian-American racial identity and queer sexuality interconnect in mutually shaping and complicating ways. Their collective aim (in the words of the editors) is \"to articulate a new conception of Asian-American racial identity, its heterogeneity, hybridity, and multiplicity-concepts that have after all underpinned the Asian-American moniker from its very inception.Q & A approaches matters of identity from a variety of points of view and academic disciplines in order to explore the multiple crossings of race and ethnicity with sexuality and gender. Drawing together the work of visual artists, fiction writers, community organizers, scholars, and participants in roundtable discussions, the collection gathers an array of voices and experiences that represent the emerging communities of a queer Asian-America. Collectively, these contributors contend that Asian-American studies needs to be more attentive to issues of sexuality and that queer studies needs to be more attentive to other aspects of difference, especially race and ethnicity. Vigorously rejecting the notion that a symmetrical relationship between race and homosexuality would weaken lesbian/gay and queer movements, the editors refuse to \"believe that a desirably queer world is one in which we remain perpetual aliens-queer houseguests-in a queer nation.

            "description": "\"Seismological Attenuation without Q\" represents a comprehensive and critical review of the present approach to describing the seismic-wave attenuation within the Earth. Starting from first physical principles, author Igor B. Morozov shows that the existing model of attenuation based on the concept of quality factor, or Q, is inadequate and represents only a phenomenological model. In most cases, Q should not be interpreted as a physical property of the Earth's medium. This text offers an alternate view developed using the concept of attenuation coefficient and illustrated using many theoretical and data examples. The new approach leads to significant advances in understanding the physics of Earth's anelasticity, measurement, and modeling attenuation of seismic waves. A systematic and hitherto unseen pattern of attenuation coefficients is recognized within a broad range of wave types and frequencies, which leads us to a general and clear picture of the attenuation structure of the Earth. At the same time, Morozov also elucidates a number of unsolved problems, such as numerical modeling and inversion for seismic attenuation and understanding its relation to the structure and the physical state of the deep Earth. Most notably, \"Seismological Attenuation without Q\" shows that the attenuation problem is significantly more complex than presented in the Q-based, visco-elastic model.",

For that reason an understanding of Q and its variation with position in the earth and with time should provide information in earth's tectonic evolution, as well as on aspects of its internal structure. Progress in understanding Q has suffered from difficulty in obtaining reliable amplitude data at global and temporary stations. Moreover, laboratory determinations of Q, until recently, were most often made at frequencies much higher than those measured by seismologists for waves propagating through the earth. Recent advances in seismic station distribution and quality, as well as in methodology at both high and low fequencies, have greatly improved the quality of observational data available to seismologists from global stations. Concurrent advances have been made in measuring Q using laboratory samples at frequencies that pertain to the earth and in theoretical understanding of seismic wave attenuation. Papers of this volume present new information on Q in the earth from several perspectives: methodology, results from global and regional observations of both body and surface waves, laboratory measurements, and theoretical understanding. The editors believe that we have reached a new threshold in Q studies and that advances in data quality and methodology will spur increased interest in this difficult, but interesting field.",

            "description": "When Stewart Petrie wrote in 1959 that 'the whole Synoptic question should be thrown back into the melting-pot', he was responding to what he saw as the fanciful and mutually contradictory attempts to solve a problem that had occupied New Testament scholars from the earliest days of biblical criticism. The 'Q' solution obscured more than it clarified, since there was no scholarly agreement on its extent, even on the assumption of its erstwhile existence. By means of its 'snap-shot' articles from the generation following Petrie s whimsical comments, this collection makes it possible to follow the course of the discussion in the subsequent forty years. Now, after a generation of study by many of the best scholarly minds, a consensus of sorts is beginning to emerge. Nonetheless, as Sharon Mattila s recent article shows, the question is 'A Problem Still Cloude', and the debate very much alive.",

He argues that Q is composed of three compositional layers, or strata, each of which reflects certain stages of development in the Q community. The earliest formative layer reflects the influence of ancient sapiential sayings: the second layer suggests the influence of the prophetic literature of judgment and contains prophetic oracles and many Son-of-Man sayings. The third layer contains a temptation story, moving the document from a chriae collection in the direction of a biography.",

Q presents Jesus as a prophetic critic of unbelief and a sage with the wisdom that can transform. In Q, the true meaning of the \"kingdom of God\" is the fulfillment of a just society through the transformation of the human relationships within it. Though this document has never been found, John Kloppenborg offers a succinct account of why scholars maintain it existed in the first place and demonstrates how they have been able to reconstruct its contents and wording from the two later Gospels that used it as a source: Matthew and Luke. Presented here in its entirety, as developed by the International Q Project, this Gospel reveals a very different portrait of Jesus than in much of the later canonical writings, challenging the way we think of Christian origins and the very nature and mission of Jesus Christ.",

The essays in Part One suggest that recent work in ethnopoetics, the ethnography of performance, and theory of verbal art (especially that of John Miles Foley) both complements and challenges standard approaches to the teaching of Jesus. They explore how Q speeches might be appreciated as oral performance that resonates with listeners in a community context by referencing Israelite popular tradition. The essays in Part Two examine how the work of anthropologist and political scientist James C. Scott on popular tradition, \"the moral economy of the peasant,\" and \"hidden transcripts\" may illuminate the social context and political implications of Q speeches. --From publisher's description.",

Chinese theorists of the mind—both traditional intellectuals and revolutionary psychologists— steadily put forward the anti-Freud: a mind shaped not by deep interiority that must be excavated by professionals, but shaped instead by social and cultural interactions. Chinese novelists and film directors understood this focus and its relationship to Mao's revolutionary ethos, and much of the literature of twentieth-century China reflects the spiritual qualities of the revolutionary mind. From Ah Q to Lei Feng investigates the continual clash of these contrasting models of the mind provided by Freud and revolutionary Chinese culture, and explores how writers and filmmakers negotiated with the implications of each model. .",

Ah Q Archaeology, however, concretely situates Lu Xun's critique of national character vis-a-vis metanarratives of nationalism and modernity through a close examination of his works in their historical context. Paul B. Foster uses a discursive approach to tie together Lu Xun's major theme of national character critique and its fate in China's tumultuous twentieth century. This book is an important and unique contribution to modern Chinese intellectual history and modern Chinese literature.",

Berger (2000) documents the increase in Bayesian activity by the number of published research articles, the number of books,andtheextensivenumberofapplicationsofBayesianarticlesinapplied disciplines such as science and engineering. One reason for the dramatic growth in Bayesian modeling is the availab- ity of computational algorithms to compute the range of integrals that are necessary in a Bayesian posterior analysis. Due to the speed of modern c- puters, it is now possible to use the Bayesian paradigm to ?t very complex models that cannot be ?t by alternative frequentist methods. To ?t Bayesian models, one needs a statistical computing environment. This environment should be such that one can: write short scripts to de?ne a Bayesian model use or write functions to summarize a posterior distribution use functions to simulate from the posterior distribution construct graphs to illustrate the posterior inference An environment that meets these requirements is the R system. R provides a wide range of functions for data manipulation, calculation, and graphical d- plays. Moreover, it includes a well-developed, simple programming language that users can extend by adding new functions. Many such extensions of the language in the form of packages are easily downloadable from the Comp- hensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",

            "description": "R is a language and environment for data analysis and graphics. It may be considered an implementation of S, an award-winning language initially - veloped at Bell Laboratories since the late 1970s. The R project was initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, in the early 1990s, and has been developed by an international team since mid-1997. Historically, econometricians have favored other computing environments, some of which have fallen by the wayside, and also a variety of packages with canned routines. We believe that R has great potential in econometrics, both for research and for teaching. There are at least three reasons for this: (1) R is mostly platform independent and runs on Microsoft Windows, the Mac family of operating systems, and various ?avors of Unix/Linux, and also on some more exotic platforms. (2) R is free software that can be downloaded and installed at no cost from a family of mirror sites around the globe, the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN); hence students can easily install it on their own machines. (3) R is open-source software, so that the full source code is available and can be inspected to understand what it really does, learn from it, and modify and extend it. We also like to think that platform independence and the open-source philosophy make R an ideal environment for reproducible econometric research.",

Computation provides access to information in text that we simply cannot gather using traditional qualitative methods of close reading and human synthesis. Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature provides a practical introduction to computational text analysis using the open source programming language R. R is extremely popular throughout the sciences and because of its accessibility, R is now used increasingly in other research areas. Readers begin working with text right away and each chapter works through a new technique or process such that readers gain a broad exposure to core R procedures and a basic understanding of the possibilities of computational text analysis at both the micro and macro scale. Each chapter builds on the previous as readers move from small scale “microanalysis” of single texts to large scale “macroanalysis” of text corpora, and each chapter concludes with a set of practice exercises that reinforce and expand upon the chapter lessons. The book’s focus is on making the technical palatable and making the technical useful and immediately gratifying.",

A key theme throughout the book is that it makes sense to base inferences or conclusions only on valid models. Plots are shown to be an important tool for both building regression models and assessing their validity. We shall see that deciding what to plot and how each plot should be interpreted will be a major challenge. In order to overcome this challenge we shall need to understand the mathematical properties of the fitted regression models and associated diagnostic procedures. As such this will be an area of focus throughout the book. In particular, we shall carefully study the properties of resi- als in order to understand when patterns in residual plots provide direct information about model misspecification and when they do not. The regression output and plots that appear throughout the book have been gen- ated using R. The output from R that appears in this book has been edited in minor ways. On the book web site you will find the R code used in each example in the text.",

The topicality and importance of correspondence analysis continue, and with the tremendous computing power now available and new fields of application emerging, its significance is greater than ever. Correspondence Analysis and Data Coding with Java and R clearly demonstrates why this technique remains important and in the eyes of many, unsurpassed as an analysis framework. After presenting some historical background, the author presents a theoretical overview of the mathematics and underlying algorithms of correspondence analysis and hierarchical clustering. The focus then shifts to data coding, with a survey of the widely varied possibilities correspondence analysis offers and introduction of the Java software for correspondence analysis, clustering, and interpretation tools. A chapter of case studies follows, wherein the author explores applications to areas such as shape analysis and time-evolving data. The final chapter reviews the wealth of studies on textual content as well as textual form, carried out by Benzécri and his research lab. These discussions show the importance of correspondence analysis to artificial intelligence as well as to stylometry and other fields. This book not only shows why correspondence analysis is important, but with a clear presentation replete with advice and guidance, also shows how to put this technique into practice. Downloadable software and data sets allow quick, hands-on exploration of innovative correspondence analysis applications.",

Samuel ben Meir (Rashbam), the grandson of Rashi and one of the leading figures in Rashi's school of exegesis in northern France. The authors show by their editing of the text, in translation and in introduction, the specific and unique contributions which Rashbam makes, not only to the understanding of Qoheleth, but to the text of the Hebrew Bible as a whole. They will surely stimulate research into the whole area of medieval exegesis. Rashbam is a Hebrew acronym for Rabbi Shmuel son of Meir (c1085-c1158). His father was Meir ben Shmuel and his mother was Yocheved, the daughter of Rashi. Like his grandfather Rashi, the Rashbam was a biblical commentator and Talmudist. He was also a leading French Tosafist. He was the older brother of the Tosafist Rivam and the Tosafist Rabbeinu Tam, also known as Jacob ben Meir. He was a colleague of Rabbi Joseph Kara. Rashbam was born in France in the vicinity of Troyes. He learned from Rashi and from the Riva. He was the teacher of his brother, Rabbeinu Tam. His commentary on the Torah is renowned for its stress on the plain meaning (peshat) of the text. This approach often led him to state views that were somewhat controversial (thus resulting in the omission of his commentary on the first chapters of Genesis in many earlier editions of the Pentateuch). Parts of his commentary on the Talmud have been preserved, and they appear on the pages of most of tractate Bava Batra (where no commentary by Rashi is available), as well as the last chapter of tractate Pesachim. Rashbam earned a living by tending livestock and growing grapes, following in his family tradition. Known for his piety, he defended Jewish beliefs in public disputes that had been arranged by church leaders to demonstrate the inferiority of Judaism.",

            "description": "Rcpp is the glue that binds the power and versatility of R with the speed and efficiency of C++. With Rcpp, the transfer of data between R and C++ is nearly seamless, and high-performance statistical computing is finally accessible to most R users. Rcpp should be part of every statistician's toolbox. -- Michael Braun, MIT Sloan School of Management \"Seamless R and C++ integration with Rcpp\" is simply a wonderful book. For anyone who uses C/C++ and R, it is an indispensable resource. The writing is outstanding. A huge bonus is the section on applications. This section covers the matrix packages Armadillo and Eigen and the GNU Scientific Library as well as RInside which enables you to use R inside C++. These applications are what most of us need to know to really do scientific programming with R and C++. I love this book. -- Robert McCulloch, University of Chicago Booth School of Business Rcpp is now considered an essential package for anybody doing serious computational research using R. Dirk's book is an excellent companion and takes the reader from a gentle introduction to more advanced applications via numerous examples and efficiency enhancing gems. The book is packed with all you might have ever wanted to know about Rcpp, its cousins (RcppArmadillo, RcppEigen .etc.), modules, package development and sugar. Overall, this book is a must-have on your shelf. -- Sanjog Misra, UCLA Anderson School of Management The Rcpp package represents a major leap forward for scientific computations with R. With very few lines of C++ code, one has R's data structures readily at hand for further computations in C++. Hence, high-level numerical programming can be made in C++ almost as easily as in R, but often with a substantial speed gain. Dirk is a crucial person in these developments, and his book takes the reader from the first fragile steps on to using the full Rcpp machinery. A very recommended book! -- Søren Højsgaard, Department of Mathematical Sciences, Aalborg University, Denmark \"Seamless R and C ++ Integration with Rcpp\" provides the first comprehensive introduction to Rcpp. Rcpp has become the most widely-used language extension for R, and is deployed by over one-hundred different CRAN and BioConductor packages. Rcpp permits users to pass scalars, vectors, matrices, list or entire R objects back and forth between R and C++ with ease. This brings the depth of the R analysis framework together with the power, speed, and efficiency of C++. Dirk Eddelbuettel has been a contributor to CRAN for over a decade and maintains around twenty packages. He is the Debian/Ubuntu maintainer for R and other quantitative software, edits the CRAN Task Views for Finance and High-Performance Computing, is a co-founder of the annual R/Finance conference, and an editor of the Journal of Statistical Software. He holds a Ph.D. in Mathematical Economics from EHESS (Paris), and works in Chicago as a Senior Quantitative Analyst.",

In addition to the built-in functions, a number of readily available packages from CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network) are also covered. All of the methods presented take advantage of the core features of R: vectorization, efficient use of subscripting, and the proper use of the varied functions in R that are provided for common data management tasks. Most experienced R users discover that, especially when working with large data sets, it may be helpful to use other programs, notably databases, in conjunction with R. Accordingly, the use of databases in R is covered in detail, along with methods for extracting data from spreadsheets and datasets created by other programs. Character manipulation, while sometimes overlooked within R, is also covered in detail, allowing problems that are traditionally solved by scripting languages to be carried out entirely within R. For users with experience in other languages, guidelines for the effective use of programming constructs like loops are provided. Since many statistical modeling and graphics functions need their data presented in a data frame, techniques for converting the output of commonly used functions to data frames are provided throughout the book.",

It connects the objectives of research to the type of experimental design required, describes the process of creating the design and collecting the data, shows how to perform the proper analysis of the data, and illustrates the interpretation of results. Drawing on his many years of working in the pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial chemicals, and machinery industries, the author teaches students how to: Make an appropriate design choice based on the objectives of a research project Create a design and perform an experiment Interpret the results of computer data analysis The book emphasizes the connection among the experimental units, the way treatments are randomized to experimental units, and the proper error term for data analysis. R code is used to create and analyze all the example experiments. The code examples from the text are available for download on the author’s website, enabling students to duplicate all the designs and data analysis. Intended for a one-semester or two-quarter course on experimental design, this text covers classical ideas in experimental design as well as the latest research topics. It gives students practical guidance on using R to analyze experimental data.",

R is a similarly flexible free and open source package for data analysis, with over 3,000 add-on packages available. This book shows you how to extend the power of Stata through the use of R. It introduces R using Stata terminology with which you are already familiar. It steps through more than 30 programs written in both languages, comparing and contrasting the two packages' different approaches. When finished, you will be able to use R in conjunction with Stata, or separately, to import data, manage and transform it, create publication quality graphics, and perform basic statistical analyses. A glossary defines over 50 R terms using Stata jargon and again using more formal R terminology. The table of contents and index allow you to find equivalent R functions by looking up Stata commands and vice versa. The example programs and practice datasets for both R and Stata are available for download.",

            "description": "This book gives you a step-by-step introduction to analysing time series using the open source software R. Each time series model is motivated with practical applications, and is defined in mathematical notation. Once the model has been introduced it is used to generate synthetic data, using R code, and these generated data are then used to estimate its parameters. This sequence enhances understanding of both the time series model and the R function used to fit the model to data. Finally, the model is used to analyse observed data taken from a practical application. By using R, the whole procedure can be reproduced by the reader. All the data sets used in the book are available on the website http://staff.elena.aut.ac.nz/Paul-Cowpertwait/ts/. The book is written for undergraduate students of mathematics, economics, business and finance, geography, engineering and related disciplines, and postgraduate students who may need to analyse time series as part of their taught programme or their research.",

It employs R, a free software environment for statistical computing, which is increasingly popular among linguists. How to do Linguistics with R: Data exploration and statistical analysis is unique in its scope, as it covers a wide range of classical and cutting-edge statistical methods, including different flavours of regression analysis and ANOVA, random forests and conditional inference trees, as well as specific linguistic approaches, among which are Behavioural Profiles, Vector Space Models and various measures of association between words and constructions. The statistical topics are presented comprehensively, but without too much technical detail, and illustrated with linguistic case studies that answer non-trivial research questions. The book also demonstrates how to visualize linguistic data with the help of attractive informative graphs, including the popular ggplot2 system and Google visualization tools.

Faraway's critically acclaimed Linear Models with R examined regression and analysis of variance, demonstrated the different methods available, and showed in which situations each one applies. Following in those footsteps, Extending the Linear Model with R surveys the techniques that grow from the regression model, presenting three extensions to that framework: generalized linear models (GLMs), mixed effect models, and nonparametric regression models. The author's treatment is thoroughly modern and covers topics that include GLM diagnostics, generalized linear mixed models, trees, and even the use of neural networks in statistics. To demonstrate the interplay of theory and practice, throughout the book the author weaves the use of the R software environment to analyze the data of real examples, providing all of the R commands necessary to reproduce the analyses. All of the data described in the book is available at http://people.bath.ac.uk/jjf23/ELM/ Statisticians need to be familiar with a broad range of ideas and techniques. This book provides a well-stocked toolbox of methodologies, and with its unique presentation of these very modern statistical techniques, holds the potential to break new ground in the way graduate-level courses in this area are taught.",

            "description": "Practical Guide to S Corporations (Fourth Edition) is written by noted practitioner, author and lecturer Michael Schlesinger. This new Fourth Edition contains extensive discussion of the changes brought about by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 and the Small Business and Work Opportunity Tax Act of 2007. It also covers Treasury regulations related to the Code Sec. 199 manufacturing deduction, as well as cases, rulings and pronouncements issued since the Third Edition.Comprised of fifteen chapters, this book starts by considering the tax advantages of electing S corporation status. The middle chapters, Chapters 2-12, detail the operations of S corporations, discussing statutory requirements, taxpayers who qualify as shareholders, and considerations when converting a C corporation to S status. Chapter 13 provides a comparison of S corporations to other business entities such as limited liability companies, partnerships, and C corporations. Chapter 14 discusses S corporation subsidiaries, and Chapter 15 covers employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) for S corporations.The book also includes detailed reference material. The Index provides the best access to particular information, but the Contents in Detail can be used as a “second index” for quick entry into the topics. The Appendices supply sample language that can be used in practice, and the Case Table and Finding Lists compile all of the cases, statutes, rulings, and regulations documented throughout the chapters.S corporations are the most popular business entity type, and this updated CCH resource helps practitioners understand and manage individual S corps election, compliance, tax, planning and life-cycle needs. It explains the merits and limitations of S corps in relation to other entity choices and provides clear and practical guidance. Readers will appreciate the Michael Schlesinger's real-world insights and crystal-clear analysis of even the most complex subjects.",

Hawkeye Pierce, Radar O'Reilly, Trapper John McIntyre, Sherman Potter, Margaret (Hot Lips) Houlihan, B.J. Hunnicutt, Frank Burns, Charles Emerson Winchester, Max Klinger--these and the many other characters who populated the MASH 4077 used the Korean War as a backdrop to comment on many of the social issues of their day. Using a unique blend of comedy and drama, the show's first three seasons (1972-1975) focused on the anti-Vietnam War sentiment that consumed much of America. As Vietnam ended, M*A*S*H moved on to concentrate on other contemporary issues--the women's movement, the rise of the religious right in American politics, the new narcissism that marked the early 1980s, the heightened awareness of underage or excessive alcohol use, and the increased emphasis on family in American life. How the series presented these issues and its success in doing so are the subjects of this critical study. An episode listing--brief plot outline, casts and credits, air dates, and titles--is also provided.",

The first essay is the printed version of Richard Albrechts paper which was delivered to the \"Second International Meeting on Genocidal Social Practices\" (November 20-24, 2007), at Universidad de Tres de Febrero, Buenos Aires, Argentinia, focussing on the continuity on Genocidal Social Practices including relevant aspects of preventing genocidal actions, too. According to the printed version of this GRIN-booklet, Richard Albrecht wrote two specific appendices: (i) under the title \"On Genocidal Affairs or What Had Happened\" the author publishes three very short notes on what stayed in his mind, to be remembered by a productive anti-genocidal memory, as Ernst Bloch puts it, \"which does not only remember what happened but also what still is to be done\"; (ii) under the title \"Murder(ing) Jews - secondly, academically, coldly ...The \"final solution\" in Germany, 1941-45, as \"realizing Utopia\" On the false world of a prominent German tenure-historian the author as scholarly as thoroughly reviews, as a radical critic, the long-living, and most effective, complete reversal (\"Umwertung aller Werte\" [Friedrich Nietzsche]) Hans Mommsen (*1930) did the last forty years in his various publications, which were - and are - widely accepted as legitimate contributions of a genocide scholar in that Gebilde named international \"scientific community.\" Richard Albrechts booklet also presents the authors c.v. and short notes on the books the autho",

The law amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to provide permanent authority for the administration of the [beta]S[gamma] visa, which was scheduled to expire on September 13, 2001. On November 29, 2001, Attorney General John Ashcroft announced the [beta]Responsible Cooperators Program[gamma] to reach out to persons who may be eligible for the S visa. Up to 200 criminal informants and 50 terrorist informants may be admitted annually. Since FY1995, almost 900 informants and their accompanying family members have entered on S visas.

Many believed he would be overmatched by the job, but Harry S. Truman would surprise them all. Few chief executives have had so lasting an impact. Truman ushered America into the nuclear age, established the alliances and principles that would define the cold war and the national security state, started the nation on the road to civil rights, and won the most dramatic election of the twentieth century—his 1948 \"whistlestop campaign\" against Thomas E. Dewey. Robert Dallek, the bestselling biographer of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, shows how this unassuming yet supremely confident man rose to the occasion. Truman clashed with Southerners over civil rights, with organized labor over the right to strike, and with General Douglas MacArthur over the conduct of the Korean War. He personified Thomas Jefferson's observation that the presidency is a \"splendid misery,\" but it was during his tenure that the United States truly came of age.",

As Martin explains it, he and his brother \"arrived on the scene at the confluence of these family streams in time to catch a ride to the shining sea.\"\" \"Martin reveals his family's struggles and triumphs as they embrace their new life in the western united States.

It is intended for students and teachers of tourism worldwide, those who earn their living through tourism or who simply like being tourists, expecially if they enjoy quizzes. Students need to know what progress they are making, to test and consolidate their knowledge. Teachers need to know their students' progress, any learning problems, what parts of the syllabus are going down well or proving difficult. Both need feedback. Arranged in ten parts, which broadly correspond to most syllabus elements studied in schools, colleges and universities, the wide-ranging repertoire also includes such topics as who was who in tourism in the UK and worldwide; what Prime Ministers thought about tourism; who are UK and world leaders in tourism; UK, US, Australian and Caribbean tourism in figures; US versus UK language; the language of North of the (English) border; creative marketing campaigns and messages. Professor Medlik is an author, consultant and educator with more than 30 years of involvement in tourism. He held several senior academic appointments in Britain and other countries, advised a number of companies, as well as tourism, educational and other organizations, and was the first chairman of the Tourism Society. His published work includes 20 books and other publications and more than 100 contributions to the professional and technical press. 1000 questions and answers Covers wide range of courses Expert panel reviewed questions !",

Much of this material has never before appeared in book form. The first part of the book emphasizes theoretical results of a probabilistic nature. In the second part of the book, these are supplemented by a variety of statistical aspects. Various generalizations and applications are dealt with in the final chapters. The material on estimation and regression models is of special value for practitioners in statistics and economics. A comprehensive bibliography of over 350 references is included.",

They differ from conventional T cells not only in T cell receptor composition, but also in their development, tissue distribution, and physiological functions. This volume contains seven chapters contributed by experts on different aspects of T cells, including the natural ligands for T cell receptors, IL-7-dependent regulation of T cell development, cytokine-mediated inter-cellular communication of T cells with other cell types, and their physiological functions in innate and adaptive immune responses. The comprehensive review articles collected in this volume will be of interest to basic immunologists who wish to update their knowledge on the biology of T cells. The book also provides a unique opportunity for non-immunologists and clinicians to understand how the immune system is specifically equipped to protect the body against pathogens at the environmental interface.",

Special attention is given to the central role of regulatory T cells (Treg) in immune regulation and induction of peripheral tolerance, as well as to the relevance of Th17 cells in chronic inflammation. The importance of Treg and Th17 cells is demonstrated in bronchial asthma, atopic eczema, contact dermatitis and delayed-type hypersensitivity. Furthermore, T-cell-mediated regulatory mechanisms in helminthic infections and fungal allergy are discussed. Several chapters are devoted to the therapeutic consequences that these recently discovered T-cell functions may have. Their role as a potential target for specific immunotherapy is evaluated and novel approaches for peripheral tolerance induction and treatment of allergic and asthmatic diseases and inflammation are suggested. Stem cell transplantation as a future therapeutic intervention in regulatory T-cell disorders is also considered. Well edited and up to date, this volume is recommended reading for allergologists, immunologists, dermatologists and any scientist interested in the immunological events regulating allergic inflammation in general and allergic manifestations in different organs.",

This revised edition, with 26 additional photographs and two new chapters, completes the portrait of Ford's life, giving depth to a man previously known only for the Model T. Through vivid photographs and narration, Ford's boundless energy and vision are revealed. An enthusiastic and courageous entrepreneur, Henry Ford used profits from the Model T to launch projects in a multitude of areas, from education to rubber production. Ford R. Bryan presents an unknown Henry Ford, focusing on his experimental humanitarian and business enterprises- including those that failed. New to this edition are chronicles of factory and general hospitals, nursing schools and services, health clinics, and a research institute established by Henry Ford, and the more than a dozen commissaries Ford operated, selling a wide assortment of items to Ford employees and their families from pillow cases to children's shoes. These accounts give testimony to Ford's investment in the well-being of the working class, a category in which he included himself despite his wealth, and disclose his dreams for a country upon which he undeniably left his mark.",

Over the past decade, attention has turned to the intrinsic properties of the memory T cells themselves, as it has become clear that the eradication of both infected cells and tumors requires T cells. This book is an attempt to capture the wave of discoveries associated with these recent studies. Its chapters represent a wide collection of topics related to memory T cells by laboratories that have invested their skills and knowledge to understand the biology and the principles upon which memory T cells are generated, maintained and expanded upon re-encounter with antigen. Ultimately, these studies are all aimed at a better understanding of the function of memory T cells in protection against disease.",

Sapolsky's acclaimed and successful Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers features new chapters on how stress affects sleep and addiction, as well as new insights into anxiety and personality disorder and the impact of spirituality on managing stress. As Sapolsky explains, most of us do not lie awake at night worrying about whether we have leprosy or malaria. Instead, the diseases we fear-and the ones that plague us now-are illnesses brought on by the slow accumulation of damage, such as heart disease and cancer. When we worry or experience stress, our body turns on the same physiological responses that an animal's does, but we do not resolve conflict in the same way-through fighting or fleeing. Over time, this activation of a stress response makes us literally sick. Combining cutting-edge research with a healthy dose of good humor and practical advice, Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers explains how prolonged stress causes or intensifies a range of physical and mental afflictions, including depression, ulcers, colitis, heart disease, and more. It also provides essential guidance to controlling our stress responses. This new edition promises to be the most comprehensive and engaging one yet.",

Tony Green believes that Christians who don't grow in their spiritual lives, miss out immeasurably on God's blessings, and come short of experiencing that abundant life that Jesus desires for all Christians. In this book he identifies twelve reasons Christians don't grow and provides helpful insights to stimulate Christian growth. In a clever and unique alliterated style each chapter outlines the reasons Christians don't grow and provides helpful scripture to support the reasons.. A must-read for any Christian serious about his or her walk with God! . The new Christian and the \"seasoned\" believer will find in Twelve Reasons Christians Don't Grow, very practical and Scriptural insights to help propel them to new levels of spiritual growth. Dr. Tony Evans, Senior Pastor, Oakcliff Bible Fellowship. . Tony Green has provided us with a very concise yet simple manual to encourage maturity and joy. Dr. Ernest Forsten, M.D., Family Physician. . This, is not another how-to-book. It concentrates on what God has done for us in Christ, and what should be our normal response. Dr. David Calhoun, Professor, Covenant Theological Seminary. Tony A. D. Green, a graduate of Dallas Theological Seminary, and US trained psychologist, is recognized as a formidable multi-lingual speaker, conducting seminars in the Caribbean and in various parts of the world.

Kazhdan in the mid 1960's with the aim of demonstrating that a large class of lattices are finitely generated. Later developments have shown that Property (T) plays an important role in an amazingly large variety of subjects, including discrete subgroups of Lie groups, ergodic theory, random walks, operator algebras, combinatorics, and theoretical computer science. This monograph offers a comprehensive introduction to the theory. It describes the two most important points of view on Property (T): the first uses a unitary group representation approach, and the second a fixed point property for affine isometric actions. Via these the authors discuss a range of important examples and applications to several domains of mathematics. A detailed appendix provides a systematic exposition of parts of the theory of group representations that are used to formulate and develop Property (T).",

The pathogenesis of RA has been the subject of intense research for several decades. The prevailing hypotheses have changed over the years, and have attempted to incorporate the most recent data. Although T cells represent an important component of the cells which infiltrate the joint synovium, their contribution at a late stage of the disease remains a matter of debate. The goal of this book is to outline the major arguments and data suggesting that T cells may, or may not, be central players in the pathogenesis of chronic RA. While each of the editors and authors has his/her own bias (as will be clear by reading the respective chapters), our hope is that the readers will enjoy a complete and balanced view of the critical questions and experiments. This is not just an intellectual exercise since the direction of future therapeutic interventions depends heavily on how one interprets the pathogenesis of RA and the contribution of T cells.",

Currently, several different cancer vaccine formulations such as peptides, proteins, antigen-pulsed dendritic cells, whole tumor cells, etc. in combination with various adjuvants and carriers are being evaluated in clinical trials (1-3). To determine the optimal cancer vaccine strategy, a surrogate immunological end-point that correlates with clinical outcome needs to be defined, since it would facilitate the rapid comparison of these various formulations. Traditional immunological assays such as ELISA, proliferation and cytotoxicity assays can detect immune responses in vaccinated patients but are not quantitative. In contrast, novel assays such as enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, intracellular cytokine assay and tetramer assay can quantitate the frequency of antigen-specific T cells. Of these, the ELISPOT assay has the 5 lowest detection limit with 1/10 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and has been determined to be one of the most useful assays to evaluate immune response to cancer vaccines (4). However, the IFN-? ELISPOT assay is not an exclusive measure of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) activity as non-cytotoxic cells can also secrete IFN-?. Additionally, CTL with lytic activity do not always secrete IFN-? (5). A more relevant approach to assess functional activity of cytotoxic lymphocytes would be to measure the secretion of molecules that are associated with lytic activity. One of the major mechanisms of cell-mediated cytotoxicity involves exocytosis of cytoplasmic granules from the effector toward the target cell.",

Considerable regulatory function has been attributed to the CD4+CD25+ T-cell subset. These cells act by suppressing adaptive and possibly innate immune responses thereby maintaining or restoring the balance between immunity and tolerance. The suppressive effects of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells are cell-contact dependent. Recent developments and viewpoints in the field of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells as well as the potential use of regulatory T-cells in immunotherapy of inflammatory diseases are discussed in this volume. By linking data from experimental models with recent findings from the clinic, this book will be of interest to immunologists and other biomedical researchers as well as clinicians interested in the regulation and manipulation of the immune response during inflammatory disease.",

John (\"My father named me after a toilet!\") wrestles with the certainty that no one really knows him -- not in his miserable home, and certainly not at school. It's true that no one can guess his hidden thoughts, which are hilarious, razor-sharp observations about lust, love, tubas, algebra, everything. And then there's his home: his father ran off years ago, so he's being raised by his mother, who works long hours, and by her boyfriend, whom John calls \"the man who is not and never will be my father.\" This man is his enemy, an abusive disciplinarian who seems to want to kill John and, in a horrible final confrontation, nearly succeeds.",

Fast forward to the present, and \"Chuggi\", as he is affectionately known, has been a pioneer in bringing the newest, biggest and baddest musical acts to Australia. These include The Police, Frank Sinatra, Liza Minelli and Sammy Davis Jr., Fleetwood Mac, R.E.M., Bon Jovi, Guns N Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Kiss, Pearl Jam, and many more. Chuggi has developed a reputation as a hard-arse, often walking on stage to shout down the crowd or pull the talent into line. He also never minces words – writing in shocking detail about what goes on behind closed doors when big international acts come to town. This honest, open and blunt expose of the underbelly of Australian music events is both hilarious and fascinating.",

He is an enigma and continues to be lauded by those who offer him and his ideas as a model for Black Progress. He was both simple and complex; a passive observer on some issues and an active participant in others; non-assuming, yet egoistic, and a very public man who talked freely with others, yet, a private man who kept certain social tactics and strategies close to his chest. He sought to both make sense of his world, then to manipulate that world in order to obtain from it those things he most wanted and needed. This volume provides the reader with a wide inter-disciplinary landscape with which to assess Washington. We continue to study and research the life and works of Washington because, though we've moved beyond Washington and the ideology of race and racial politics of his times on certain levels, yet in reality, this generation is confronted with all the contradictions and ambiguities around race, and class, which Washington encountered and for which he sought solutions. For example, as black Americans continue to be mired in the deficits of educational opportunity and development, employment opportunities and occupational advancements, and health and medical problems, we are reminded of Washington's arguments for greater individual and group black self-sufficiency and self-reliance, as well as the need for practical educational objectives which Washington advocated under aegis of vocational education. As we move into the new century, the economic and educational goals and programs highlighted by Washington remain forgotten and unfulfilled. Hopefully, the articles in this volume will force a re-thinking of Was",

The public reads about a medical research project that announces unbelievable results for a miraculous drug. Some years later, another investigation completely wipes out those initial favorable findings. Hormones Cut Women’s Risk of Heart Disease (San Francisco Chronicle, 1994) Hormones Don’t Protect Women from Heart Disease, Study Says (Washington Post, 2001) The people are confused because we do not understand the process behind these conflicting results. Our health, and in fact, our very lives are dependent on clinical trials, but we know little about them. This book explains the issues the public needs to be aware of when it comes to clinical research. It uncovers the problems in medical investigations that can not be overcome no matter how much care and diligence medical researchers bring to a research project. The basic premise that drives the writing is that it is impossible for medical researchers to guarantee that they can get all the right answers from a single study. No matter how good the investigators are, no matter how well a study is planned, no matter how carefully the plans are executed and no matter how conscientiously the results are analyzed and interpreted – the answer may still be wrong. The deck is stacked against medical researchers and the public – you – should be skeptical of the results no matter how impressive they seem on the surface.",

Within months, the US Air Force hired Rocketdyne for a feasibility study of an engine capable of delivering at least 1 million pounds of thrust. Later, NASA ran the development of this F-1 engine in order to use it to power the first stage of the Saturn V rocket that would send Apollo missions to the Moon. It is no exaggeration to say that without the F-1 engine NASA would not have been able to achieve President Kennedy’s 1961 challenge to his nation to land a man on the Moon before the decade was out.",

What was accepted at the turn of the century as a patriotic celebration of a national hero has emerged in the modern theater as a dark and troubling analysis of the causes and costs of war. This book details the theatrical innovations and political insights that have turned one of Shakespeare's most tradition-bound plays into one of his most popular and provocative.",

Paralleling the graphic novel, the film simultaneously reflects a range of authorial contributions and influences. This work examines in detail the intersecting texts of V for Vendetta. Subjects include the alternative dimensions of the cinematic narrative, represented in the film's conspicuous placement of the painting The Lady of Shalott in V's home; the film's overt allusions to the AIDS panic of the 1980s; and the ways in which antecedent narratives such as Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Huxley's Brave New World, and Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 represent shadow texts frequently crossing through the overall V for Vendetta narrative.",

This collection of persuasive scholarly essays examines, for the first time, the role rhetorical theory played in the development of educational segregation. Contributors consider the NAACPOs development of a series of graduate school cases to challenge Plessy, analyze the Brown decision itself, assess the state response to Brown, and critique the two Supreme Court decisions implementing the Brown decision. By illustrating how rhetorical strategies created, sustained, challenged, and, ultimately, reversed educational segregation in the United States, this work demonstrates the real value of the rhetorical perspective and provides encouragement to those who wish to help further develop this emerging field of judicial rhetoric.",

This question faced the U.S. Supreme Court in 1962 when they heard arguments in Engel v. Vitale. What some observers considered to be nothing more than a school tradition became the basis of a key constitutional question dealing with religious freedom and the meaning of separation of church and state in the United States. Engel v. Vitale serves as a useful primer of an issue that remains an emotionally charged one today. Combining absorbing profiles of key litigants with carefully selected full-color photographs, extensive footnotes, and a chronology and timeline, historian Shane Mountjoy provides excellent coverage of this decisive case.",

This thought-provoking volume -- produced as a partnership between the American Psychiatric Association, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse -- represents a far-reaching attempt to stimulate research and discussion in the field in preparation for the eventual start of the DSM-V process, still several years hence. The book Explores a variety of basic nomenclature issues, including the desirability of rating the quality and quantity of information available to support the different disorders in the DSM in order to indicate the disparity of empirical support across the diagnostic system. Offers a neuroscience research agenda to guide development of a pathophysiologically based classification for DSM-V, which reviews genetic, brain imaging, postmortem, and animal model research and includes strategic insights for a new research agenda. Presents highlights of recent progress in developmental neuroscience, genetics, psychology, psychopathology, and epidemiology, using a bioecological perspective to focus on the first two decades of life, when rapid changes in behavior, emotion and cognition occur. Discusses how to address two important gaps in the current DSM-IV: (1) the categorical method of diagnosing personality disorders and their relationship with Axis I disorders, and (2) the limited provision for the diagnosis of relational disorders -- suggesting a research agenda for personality disorders that considers replacing the current categorical approach with a dimensional classification of personality. Reevaluates the relationship between mental disorders and disability, asserting that research into disability and impairment would benefit from the diagnosis of mental disorders be uncoupled from a requirement for impairment or disability to foster a more vigorous research agenda on the etiologies, courses, and treatment of mental disorders as well as disabilities and to avert unintended consequences of delayed diagnosis and treatment. Examines the importance of culture in psychopathology and the main cultural variables at play in the diagnostic process, stating that training present and future professionals in the need to include cultural factors in the diagnostic process is a logical step in any attempt to develop comprehensive research programs in psychology, psychiatry, and related disciplines. This fascinating work, with contributions from an international group of research investigators, reaches into the core of psychiatry, providing invaluable background and insights for all psychology and psychiatry professionals -- food for thought and further research that will be relevant for years to come.",

            "description": "Henry V is Shakespeare's most famous \"war play\"; it includes the storied English victory over the French at Agincourt. Some of it glorifies war, especially the choruses and Henry's speeches urging his troops into battle. But we also hear bishops conniving for war to postpone a bill that would tax the church, and soldiers expecting to reap profits from the conflict. Even in the speeches of Henry and his nobles, there are many chilling references to the human cost of war. The authoritative edition of Henry V from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, is now available as an eBook. Features include: · The exact text of the printed book for easy cross-reference · Hundreds of hypertext links for instant navigation · Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play · Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play · Scene-by-scene plot summaries · A key to famous lines and phrases · An introduction to reading Shakespeare’s language · Illustrations from the Folger Shakespeare Library’s vast holdings of rare books · An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play",

He analyses the play's double vision of Henry as both military hero and self-seeking individual. Professor Gurr shows how the patriotic declarations of the Chorus are contradicted by the play's action. The play's more controversial sequences are placed in the context of Elizabethan thought, in particular the studies of the laws and morality of war written in the years before Henry V. Also studied is the exceptional variety of language and dialect in the play. The appendices provide a comprehensive collection of source materials, while the stage history shows how subsequent centuries have received and adapted the play on the stage and in film. An updated reading list completes the edition.",

Yet, for many-from experienced scientists to trainees-it represents a (rather too) sophisticated process whose true insight is excessively demanding. However, when not simplyconsidered as a private ground for a few aficionados, it can be seen as a way of understanding how maturelympho cytes carry on their basic functions. For the group of aficionados-which includes this editor-it is an elegant paradigm featuring many fascinating evolutionary achievements of which the biological world alone has the secret. These include a subtle biochemical principle most likelyhijacked some 470 million years ago from an ancestral gene invader and since then cleverly adapted by jawed vertebrates to precisely cleave and rearrange their antigen receptor (Ig andTCR)loci. This invader would itself have assigned the services of the nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) DNArepair machinery as well as various DNApolymerases or transferases to work in concert with developmental clues in lymphoid cell lineages to generate an immune repertoire and efficient host surveillance while avoiding autoimmunity. Recently, important new refinements in these systems have emerged, continuing to challenge ourknowledge andbeliefs. These arejust thetopics covered by the senior authors-all established leaders in this field-and their colleagues, whilst writing the various chapters in V(D)J Recombination.",

The material covered begins with a review of specific properties of III-V semiconductors and available technologies making them attractive to MOSFET technology, such as band-engineered heterostructures, effect of strain, nanoscale control during epitaxial growth. Due to the lack of thermodynamically stable native oxides on III-V's (such as SiO2 on Si), high-k oxides are the natural choice of dielectrics for III-V MOSFETs. The key challenge of the III-V MOSFET technology is a high-quality, thermodynamically stable gate dielectric that passivates the interface states, similar to SiO2 on Si. Several chapters give a detailed description of materials science and electronic behavior of various dielectrics and related interfaces, as well as physics of fabricated devices and MOSFET fabrication technologies. Topics also include recent progress and understanding of various materials systems; specific issues for electrical measurement of gate stacks and FETs with low and wide bandgap channels and high interface trap density; possible paths of integration of different semiconductor materials on Si platform.",

            "description": "W a n t. — an ongoing project begun in the depths of disillusionment and dead ends, inspired by the word itself and the tormented feelings it generated, a hollow term with no resolve. Wallowing in the disappointment of failure, the author meandered aimlessly through the cracks of social strata in search of definition... literally. “Lack, insufficiency, absence, inability,” the familiar definitions of want, words that he knew all too well. And then Karl Larsen set out to change all that. Besides the instructions provided by the author on how to understand your desires, where they come from and what do with them, the book details his journey from a near-death experience to the moment he began piecing his life together to uncover the unlikely paths to his own success. Inspired by experiences both good and bad, he discovers he must overcome and accept his past in order to harness his own re-creation and become who and what he wants to be. Larsen returned to his South Carolina roots in the fall of 2008 following a 4-year downward spiral in North Carolina. He found himself in back Columbia, a bustling Southern city on the verge of a renaissance. Full of energy and the unflinching desire to free himself from a life so far defined by disappointment, complacency and, often, despair, a series of life-changing events began. Since the release of his first project, W a n t., Larsen has dedicated most of his time and energy to serving his city through public art projects and community service, one of the many paths that opened to him. W a n t. is currently in its sixth printing, with the seventh pending. 2014 is a milestone for Larsen and his book. As of October 17, W a n t. will have been happily self-published for three years. Larsen believes strongly in self-publishing, treating his work as a project, not a product. For the anniversary release, new cover art is in the works as well as some minor revisions. Today, W a n t., in its current edition, is available in paperback only. Although the author has shied away from major publishers and bookstores, his book has managed to find itself scattered across the country and as far away as Japan, Norway, United Kingdom and Kuwait.",

In Bill W. and Mr. Wilson, Matthew J. Raphael, himself a member of A.A. (and writing here under a pseudonym, in accord with AA's tradition of anonymity), presents a revealing new look at both the legendary Bill W. and the private Mr. Wilson, who tried to live apart from his own celebrity. In quest of a more historically accurate and complete account, Raphael separates fact from fiction in the standard biographies of Wilson and finds reason to doubt the literal truth of some foundational AA stories. He also provides a context for Wilson's (and thus AA's) key ideas in the work of William James, Carl Jung, and other modern thinkers. What emerges is an unvarnished portrait of a charismatic man and social visionary, whose true greatness is all the more apparent in view of his human imperfections. Readers already familiar with Alcoholics Anonymous will find much to engage them. Others will discover AA and its cofounder from an insider's perspective.",

The project was supported by the European Commission under the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Development. The aim of CARE-W was to support European water companies in their decisions on upgrading their water supply. The system has been developed for and tested by cities representing all parts of Europe. CARE-W consists of software dealing with fundamental instruments for estimating the current and future condition of water networks, including tools to assess performance indicators (PI), to predict pipe failures (FAIL) and to calculate water supply reliability (REL). Based on the results of these tools, annual rehabilitation projects are selected and ranked (ARP tool). Information of network is further used for the estimation of long-term investments needs (LTP). The tools are operated jointly within the \"CARE-W Manager\", which also contains facilities for using pipe network databases, geographical information systems (GIS) and input/output routines. The results from using the procedures are presented by reports, in tables and graphically. Aimed at planning engineers, water utilities and municipalities and consultants working in the increasingly growing field of the planning of rehabilitation of water networks in cities.",

            "description": "The Presidency of George W. Bush brings together some of today's top American historians to offer the first in-depth look at one of the most controversial U.S. presidencies. Emotions surrounding the Bush presidency continue to run high--conservatives steadfastly defend its achievements, liberals call it a disgrace. This book examines the successes as well as the failures, covering every major aspect of Bush's two terms in office. It puts issues in broad historical context to reveal the forces that shaped and constrained Bush's presidency--and the ways his presidency reshaped the nation. The Presidency of George W. Bush features contributions by Mary L. Dudziak, Gary Gerstle, David Greenberg, Meg Jacobs, Michael Kazin, Kevin M. Kruse, Nelson Lichtenstein, Fredrik Logevall, Timothy Naftali, James T. Patterson, and the book's editor, Julian E. Zelizer. Each chapter tackles some important aspect of Bush's administration--such as presidential power, law, the war on terror, the Iraq invasion, economic policy, and religion--and helps readers understand why Bush made the decisions he did. Taking readers behind the headlines of momentous events, the contributors show how the quandaries of the Bush presidency were essentially those of conservatism itself, which was confronted by the hard realities of governance. They demonstrate how in fact Bush frequently disappointed the Right, and how Barack Obama's 2008 election victory cast the very tenets of conservatism in doubt. History will be the ultimate judge of Bush's legacy, and the assessment begins with this book.",

            "description": "Willard Waller (1899-1945) taught and wrote on sociology during the decades of its crystallization, the 1920s through the 1940s. He pursued sociological analysis in terms of intensive direct observation and humanistic detail as well as conceptual analysis. Waller's explorations of role behavior, especially in his writings on marriage and education, shocked academia and are still provocative today. In his direct, perceptive, often cynical style, he penetrated the facades of the most respected social institutions. He made use of the case study method; many of Waller's case studies were lifted directly from his own experiences, particularly from the agonies of his own divorce and from the disappointments of his initial teaching experience. He also drew fresh insights from the personal experiences of his colleagues and students, hardly a traditional procedure. This volume is the first unified presentation of Waller's writings, covering in depth his work on family, education, and war. It also includes his shorter, but equally vivid, discussions on social problems such as crime and on the conflict between insight and scientific method. Since Waller's private life was so intimately bound to his public work, an understanding of his personal history reveals much about the development and dilemma of sociologists in the United States. In their Introduction editors Goode, Mitchell, and Furstenberg reconstruct the life of this complex American thinker.",

            "description": "W-symmetry is an extension of conformal symmetry in two dimensions. Since its introduction in 1985, W-symmetry has become one of the central notions in the study of two-dimensional conformal field theory. The mathematical structures that underlie W-symmetry are so-called W-algebras, which are higher-spin extensions of the Virasoro algebra. This book contains a collection of papers on W-symmetry, covering the period from 1985 through 1993. Its main focus is the construction of W-algebras and their representation theory. A recurrent theme is the intimate connection between W-algebras and affine Lie algebras. Some of the applications, in particular W-gravity, are also covered. The significance of this reprint volume is that there are no textbooks entirely devoted to the subject.

            "description": "Howard W. Odum (1884-1954), the pioneering social scientist and founder of the University of North Carolina's department of sociology, played a leading and well-documented role in the modernization of the South. This is the first book-length study of Odum's contributions to southern folklore, which had important but largely unappreciated consequences for his legacy of social justice. Lynn Moss Sanders shows how Odum, as a collector of African American blues and work songs, anticipated some important precepts of modern folklore. Notably, Odum perceived the benefits of a collaborative and nonhierarchical approach to folk studies. Influenced by a racially tolerant former student and by one of his black folk informants, Odum changed his previous paternal, segregationist attitudes about race. Comparing Odum's two song collections, The Negro and His Songs (1925) and Negro Workaday Songs (1926), Sanders links the growing influence of Odum's coauthor and former student, Guy Johnson, to a decrease in instances of racial condescension between the first and second book. The three \"folk\" novels in Odum's Black Ulysses trilogy (completed in 1931) also reveal a progressive refinement of Odum's racial views. The change, Sanders believes, came with Odum's growing ability to see John Wesley \"Left-Wing\" Gordon, the black, working-class model for the trilogy's hero, as a friend rather than simply as a representative of \"the Negro.\" From his authorship of Social and Mental Traits of the Negro (1910), now a relic of scientific racism, to his final publication, Agenda for Integration, Odum exemplifies how the study of folklore changed the folklorist--a change felt by a whole generation of southern liberals whose work Odum encouraged and shaped.",

The programs were always of the highest quality and conducted with integrity. The students and coaches involved were dedicated and committed to their respective sport. Loss of the Physical Education Assembly Building, destroyed by a tornado in 2002, and the subsequent decision (2003) by the university to cease participation in intercollegiate athletics prompted the writing of this book. Physical resources and historical records had been destroyed. Concern that the knowledge of this program would be lost along with its signifi cance to the university alumnae, and womens sport history, challenged five retired Health and Kinesiology faculty members to write this book. They knew that their collective knowledge and experiences were invaluable in recording a century of athletic competition at the W. These women promoted the educational model of sport believing that the opportunity to participate in sports brings both value and pleasure to the quality of life.",

Early in the 20th Century her parents came to America as children from Eastern Europe. This book of memories begins with the story of their courageous journey across a continent and an ocean to a new beginning. It then takes us through her childhood, growing up in Brooklyn, New York during the depression and the impact of World War II. Graduation from Brooklyn College was an important milestone. Then marriage and raising a family of six children. The final sections concern retirement, her life in Atlanta, and adventures with all the grandchildren. Leila has been collecting stories for seventy-nine years but it wasn't until she retired that she started writing them down. This collection began as an annual letter of stories and reminiscences sent to her children and grandchildren. It soon became apparent that the stories needed to be collected and published. What she considered her 'ordinary' life is perhaps more extraordinary than she thought. This work has been a labor of love and there are many stories yet to be written. Volume two must be on the way because we still don't know the logic behind David's request for Spanish Pie for his birthday cake, or about the day Ilene played hooky from school, or when Wendy was left behind in the Capitol in Washington, DC, or the story of how Quanky, Marcie's toy duck, went flying out the car window..............",

            "description": "When Bill Wilson, with his friend Dr. Bob Smith, founded Alcoholics Anonymous in 1935, his hope was that AA would become a safe haven for those who suffered from this disease. Thirty years after his death, AA continues to help millions of alcoholics recover from what had been commonly regarded as a hopeless addiction. Still, while Wilson was a visionary for millions, he was no saint. After cofounding Alcoholics Anonymous, he stayed sober for over thirty-five years, helping countless thousands rebuild their lives. But at the same time, Wilson suffered form debilitating bouts of clinical depression, was a womanizer, and experimented with LSD. Francis Hartigan, the former secretary and confidant to Wilson's wife, Lois, has exhaustively researched his subject, writing with a complete insider's knowledge. Drawing on extensive interviews with Lois Wilson and scores of early members of AA, he fully explores Wilson's organizational genius, his devotion to the cause, and almost martyr-like selflessness. That Wilson, like all of us, had to struggle with his own personal demons makes this biography all the more moving and inspirational. Hartigan reveals the story of Wilson's life to be as humorous, horrific, and powerful as any of the AA vignettes told daily around the world.",

Do you know how they really feel? Do you know what they say when you re not around? In an always-on world where everyone is connected to information and also one another, customer experience is your brand. And, without defining experiences, brands become victim to whatever people feel and share. In his new book X: The Experience When Business Meets Design bestselling author Brian Solis shares why great products are no longer good enough to win with customers and why creative marketing and delightful customer service too are not enough to succeed. In X, he shares why the future of business is experiential and how to create and cultivate meaningful experiences. This isn’t your ordinary business book. The idea of a book was re-imagined for a digital meets analog world to be a relevant and sensational experience. Its aesthetic was meant to evoke emotion while also giving new perspective and insights to help you win the hearts and minds of your customers. And, the design of this book, along with what fills its pages, was done using the principles shared within. Brian shares more than the importance of experience. You’ll learn how to design a desired, meaningful and uniform experience in every moment of truth in a fun way including: How our own experience gets in the way of designing for people not like us Why empathy and new perspective unlock creativity and innovation The importance of User Experience (UX) in real life and in executive thinking The humanity of Human-Centered Design in all you do The art of Hollywood storytelling from marketing to product design to packaging Apple’s holistic approach to experience architecture The value of different journey and experience mapping approaches The future of business lies in experience architecture and you are the architect. Business, meet design. X",

Some fields such as basic biochemistry, organic reaction mechanisms, and chemical thermodynamics are well represented by many excellent texts, and new or revised editions are published sufficiently often to keep up with progress in research. However, some areas of chemistry, especially many of those taught at the graduate level, suffer from a real lack of up to-date textbooks. The most serious needs occur in fields that are rapidly changing. Textbooks in these subjects usually have to be written by scientists actually involved in the research that is advancing the field. It is not often easy to persuade such individuals to set time aside to help spread the knowledge they have accumulated. Our goal, in this series, is to pinpoint areas of chemistry where recent progress has outpaced what is covered in any available textbooks, and then seek out and persuade experts in these fields to produce relatively concise but instructive intro ductions to their fields. These should serve the needs of one-semester or one-quarter graduate courses in chemistry and biochemistry. In some cases, the availability of texts in active research areas should help stimulate the creation of new courses. Charles R. Cantor v Preface to the Second Edition Since the publication of the previous edition in 1994, X-ray crystallography of proteins has advanced by improvements in existing techniques and by addition of new techniques.",

Mac OS X for Unix Geeks serves as a bridge between Apple's Darwin OS and the more traditional Unix systems. This clear, concise guide gives you a tour of Mac OS X's Unix shell in both Leopard and Tiger, and helps you find the facilities that replace or correspond to standard Unix utilities. You'll learn how to perform common Unix tasks in Mac OS X, such as using Directory Services instead of the standard Unix /etc/passwd and /etc/group, and you'll be able to compile code, link to libraries, and port Unix software using either Leopard and Tiger. This book teaches you to: Navigate the Terminal and understand how it differs from an xterm Use Open Directory (LDAP) and NetInfo as well as Directory Services Compile your code with GCC 4 Port Unix programs to Mac OS X with Fink Use MacPorts to install free/open source software Search through metadata with Spotlight's command-line utilities Build the Darwin kernel And there's much more. Mac OS X for Unix Geeks is the ideal survival guide to tame the Unix side of Leopard and Tiger. If you're a Unix geek with an interest in Mac OS X, you'll soon find that this book is invaluable.",

X-ray crystallography is a universal tool for studying molecular structure, and the complementary nature of neutron diffraction crystallography permits the location of atomic species in crystals which are not easily revealed by X-ray techniques alone, such as hydrogen atoms or other light atoms in the presence of heavier atoms. Thus, a chapter discussing the practice of neutron diffraction techniques, with examples, broadens the scope of the text in a highly desirable way. As with previous editions, the book contains problems to illustrate the work of each chapter, and detailed solutions are provided. Mathematical procedures related to the material of the main body of the book are not discussed in detail, but are quoted where needed with references to standard mathematical texts. To address the computational aspect of crystallography, the suite of computer programs from the fourth edition has been revised and expanded. The programs enable the reader to participate fully in many of the aspects of x-ray crystallography discussed in the book. In particular, the program system XRAY* is interactive, and enables the reader to follow through, at the monitor screen, the computational techniques involved in single-crystal structure determination, albeit in two dimensions, with the data sets provided. Exercises for students can be found in the book, and solutions are available to instructors.",

            "description": "Millions of Americans follow the \"best\" medical advice every day to prevent heart attacks -- eating the standard low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet so widely recommended by doctors -- but in fact they are placing themselves at greater risk for heart disease. In Syndrome X: Overcoming the Silent Killer That Can Give You a Heart Attack, Dr. Gerald Reaven, the world-renowned physician who identified and named this silent killer, explains why the standard heart-healthy diet can be dangerous and lays out a simple six-step program to reduce the risk of heart disease for everyone. The problem stems from a little-known cluster of metabolic abnormalities known as Syndrome X. The insulin resistance that lies at the heart of the syndrome can turn normal rules of good health upside down and dramatically increase the risk of heart disease. Fortunately, Syndrome X can be cured. This important book explains how to identify the disorder and provides a program of diet and exercise (plus medication when necessary) that can render Syndrome X harmless. Tested in carefully controlled research settings and in practice, this remarkable new approach has the ability to reduce the risk of heart attacks and heart disease for all of us. Dr. Reaven shows how eating a diet relatively high in \"good\" fats (40 percent of calories) can dramatically lower the risk of heart disease if you have Syndrome X. The approach seems paradoxical: Everyone \"knows\" that fat is bad, so how can more fat possibly lead to better health? The answer lies in the type of fat and the body chemistry of the people who consume it. If you have the abnormal metabolism called Syndrome X, eating a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet to lower your LDL and blood fats won't protect you. In fact, doing so will increase the odds of heart disease. Millions of Americans have the potentially deadly, yet easily identifiable signs of Syndrome X -- but few cases are detected in time, because most physicians don't know what to look for. This trailblazing book will change that, making doctors and patients aware of the problem -- and its easy solution, an integrated program of diet and exercise that simultaneously reduces all the risk factors for heart disease, including Syndrome X. Dr. Reaven's discovery of Syndrome X has shown us that the standard approach to preventing heart disease is dangerous for many of us. Now, his safe, proven new approach explains how millions can drastically reduce their risk of heart disease. His program works not only for those who have Syndrome X, but also for anyone who simply wants to reduce the risk of heart disease.",

            "description": "During the last four decades remarkable developments have taken place in instrumentation and techniques for characterizing the microstructure and microcomposition of materials. Some of the most important of these instruments involve the use of electron beams because of the wealth of information that can be obtained from the interaction of electron beams with matter. The principal instruments include the scanning electron microscope, electron probe x-ray microanalyzer, and the analytical transmission electron microscope. The training of students to use these instruments and to apply the new techniques that are possible with them is an important function, which. has been carried out by formal classes in universities and colleges and by special summer courses such as the ones offered for the past 19 years at Lehigh University. Laboratory work, which should be an integral part of such courses, is often hindered by the lack of a suitable laboratory workbook. While laboratory workbooks for transmission electron microscopy have-been in existence for many years, the broad range of topics that must be dealt with in scanning electron microscopy and microanalysis has made it difficult for instructors to devise meaningful experiments. The present workbook provides a series of fundamental experiments to aid in \"hands-on\" learning of the use of the instrumentation and the techniques. It is written by a group of eminently qualified scientists and educators. The importance of hands-on learning cannot be overemphasized.",

Recently eclipsed by other instrumentation such as LA-ICP-MS, XRF remains the mainstay of non-destructive chemical analyses in archaeology, particularly for volcanic rocks, and most particularly for obsidian. In a world where heritage and repatriation issues drive archaeological method and theory, XRF remains an important tool for understanding the human past, and will remain so for decades to come. Currently, there is no comprehensive book in XRF applications in archaeology at a time when the applications of portable XRF and desktop XRF instrumentation are exploding particularly in anthropology and archaeology departments worldwide. The contributors to this volume are the experts in the field, and most are at the forefront of the newest applications of XRF to archaeological problems. It covers all relevant aspects of the field for those using the newest XRF technologies to deal with very current issues in archaeology.",

With effervescent wit, Jones argues that men, biologically speaking, are the true second sex. Here he lays out the cases for and against masculinity -- exploring every biological aspect from the genesis of the Y chromosome onward -- based on the recent explosion of biological research. Along the way, he offers pithy commentary on topics such as male hormones, hair loss, and the hydraulics of man's most intimate organ. Fascinating and often surprising, Jones's evidence offers fresh fuel for the battle of the sexes.",

Dr Dobson divides his study into sections devoted to Ortega's political thinking and to his philosophy, rooting these in the context of contemporary Spain and discussing the wider implications of their influence. He examines Ortega's position with regard to the Civil War, his ambivalent espousal of socialism, his emphasis on the importance of the select individual in the modernisation of society and creation of a nació vital; the appropriation of his ideas by Primo de Rivera in the cause of fascism. This book is intended to be accessible to both Hispanists and general readers with an interest in literature, history, intellectual and political thought and philosophy.",

            "description": "Jose Ortega y Gasset (1883-1955), the most widely known and well liked of Spanish philosophers, was much admired in the United States from the 1930s through the 1960s for Revolt of the Masses, History as a System, and Dehumanization of Art, among other works. Those popular works, however, poorly reflected the complexity of Ortega's philosophy. In this first historical analysis of all the parts of Ortega's total thought, John Graham explores the extent to which Ortega's metaphysics was built not only on a native Spanish realism but also upon the pragmatism of William James. Graham details the extent to which Ortega developed an existentialsim before Martin Heidegger and a new historicism less absolute than Benedetto Croce's, by means of a phenomenological method-all within a comprehensive philosophy of life similar to Wilhelm Dilthey's, but more realist and social. In addition, an extensive bibliographical essay examines how Ortega's philosophy, as a whole and in each part, has stood in the estimation of critics worldwide from the 1920s to the present. Over ten years in preparation, A Pragmatist Philosophy of Life in Ortega y Gasset reveals how open, adaptable, and inventive was pragmatism as Ortega elaborated its philosophical implications and applications for Spain, Europe, and the Americas. It is based on extensive use of the twelve volumes of Ortega's Obras completas, the eighty microfilm reels of his archive in the Library of Congress, and his private library of fifteen hundred volumes in Madrid. These sources, many of which have not been available previously, provide the essential evidence needed to demonstrate the novelty and subtlety, the diversity and unity, of Ortega's thematic \"system\" of thought. Students and scholars of intellectual history, Spanish literature, and philosophy will welcome this important new study.",

Growing up during the information age, China's Generation Y (born between 1981 and 1995) is unlike any of its predecessors, sporting branded items and increasingly sharing some of the same ideas as western youth. Living in a rapidly developing country, this generation of teenagers in China will most likely be the political and business leaders of the world's next superpower by the year 2025. China's Generation Y explores these perspectives by delving into the nooks and crannies of Chinese teenagers' stories. The book is not only for those who seek to acquaint themselves with this crucial generation from the perspective of a western peer, but also for business leaders who wish to cater to the up-and-coming Chinese consumers. Informative and stimulating, this book will open up a new horizon for many in the west who will ultimately meet the need and challenge of this emerging Chinese generation.",

Rather than coming across as having all the answers, Danielle puts her ideas in the form of a conversation. Yet at her core she has convictions that come from a faith rooted in her heart as well as her head. Y God will appeal to millennials (the Y generation) and anyone who has ever had doubts about the biblical story of God. Some of the questions include: Is faith reasonable? Are miracles really possible? Is the Bible literally true? Is God the author of morality? Are other religions false? Is America a “Christian nation”? Does anyone deserve hell? Why do people become atheists? Is science at war with religion? Is evolution compatible with the Bible? If Jesus did exist, who was he? How would Christianity change my life?",

In Neuropeptide Y Protocols, a strong cohort of established investigators from a variety of disciplines detail their best techniques for advancing NPY research. Among the many readily reproducible methods described are those for cloning, for the production of transgenic and knockout models, and for the use of antisense technology to define the receptors and the signal transduction pathways mediating NPY actions. A range of the major qualitative and quantitative techniques used to study tissue mRNA distribution are also included, as well as methods for radioligand binding. The cloning techniques utilize genomic DNA isolation, expression cloning, PCR cloning, the construction of hybrid receptors, and homology-based cloning. Highly practical and state-of-the-art, Neuropeptide Y Protocols constitutes a gold-standard collection of proven techniques for advancing today's understanding of this significant neuropeptide, as well as for developing the promising NPY-based therapeutics now emerging for many important disorders.",

Guaman Poma dedicated his Chronicle to Philip III, King of Spain, but it has been preserved since the 18th century in the Royal Library, Copenhagen. 'Rediscovered' by modern scholarship in 1908, it was included in UNESCO's 'Memory of the World' list in 1999. Written and illustrated by a Christianised native Andean of Southern Peru, several decades after the Spanish conquest, the Nueva corónica is a complex and unique mixture of historiography and utopianism. On one hand, it contains an entirely original framework for Andean historical self-understanding, as an alternative to the colonial viewpoint. On the other hand, based upon vivid written and graphic descriptions of Andean daily life and sufferings under colonial rule, Guaman Poma formulates far-reaching proposals for reform aimed at turning the chaotic viceroyalty into a dynamic self-governed kingdom within the Spanish empire. Guaman Poma envisioned this new order as Christian, but organised in accordance with Andean economic, social, and cultural tradition.",

La sociocibernética y la teoría de sistemas plantean un marco conceptual esencial para el necesario debate sobre el papel de la tecnología en la configuración de la complejidad social. La tecnología permite al sistema social gestionar la complejidad social. La tecnología permite al sistema social gestionar la complejidad de su entorno a la vez que, por otra parte, contribuye a incrementar y diversificar la naturaleza compleja de las interdependencias entre la sociedad y los actores individuales. Simultáneamente, la creciente complejidad social demanda nuevas formas tecnológicas que permitan gestionarla. En suma, la tecnología se halla en la base de cualquier discusión relevante sobre la naturaleza contemporánea de la sociedad, ya sea del lado de los problemas (riesgo, control, y vigilancia global, bioética y bioingeniería, manipulación mediática, ecológica etc.) o del lado de las soluciones (comunicaciones instantáneas, ubicuidad y movilidad, accesibilidad, disponibilidad de conocimiento, etc.).",

Unfortunately, Slovenia had to fight for its independence, which it did not fully achieve until 1995 after its bloody disintegration with Yugoslavia was over. Since independence, however, Slovenia has prospered; its economy is far ahead of other former communist states and in 2004 Slovenia acceded to both NATO and the European Union, the only republic of former Yugoslavia to do so. The A to Z of Slovenia covers the history of Slovenia and its struggle to gain independence from communism. This is done through a detailed chronology, an introduction, appendixes, a bibliography, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on some of the more significant persons, places, and events; institutions and organizations; and political, economic, social, cultural, and religious facets.",

It is the most extensive compendium of information about the singers, composers, bands, instruments, and dances of Cuba ever assembled. With more than 1,300 entries and 150 illustrations, this volume is an essential reference guide to the music of the island that brought the world the danzón, the son, the mambo, the conga, and the cha-cha-chá. The life’s work of Cuban historian and musician Helio Orovio, Cuban Music from A to Z presents the people, genres, and history of Cuban music. Arranged alphabetically and cross-referenced, the entries span from Abakuá music and dance to Eddy Zervigón, a Cuban bandleader based in New York City. They reveal an extraordinary fusion of musical elements, evident in the unique blend of African and Spanish traditions of the son musical genre and in the integration of jazz and rumba in the timba style developed by bands like Afrocuba, Chucho Valdés’s Irakeke, José Luis Cortés’s ng La Banda, and the Buena Vista Social Club. Folk and classical music, little-known composers and international superstars, drums and string instruments, symphonies and theaters—it’s all here.",

A to Z explores, letter by letter, how the English language, when used well, can be a powerful tool for writing, communication and creative expression for studies, business, entertainment and enjoyment. With the use of many examples and some amusing anecdotes, it also shows how, when used incorrectly, it can make one thing mean something entirely different! The book informs and reminds readers of the basics of grammar and punctuation, while offering tips on vocabulary for impressive communication. Simultaneously authoritative and friendly, this is the perfect book for students, lovers of language and everyone who wants to explore the nuances of the English language, and succeed at clear, correct and smart communication.",

We have never been what we seemed. When beautiful, reckless Southern belle Zelda Sayre meets F. Scott Fitzgerald at a country club dance in 1918, she is seventeen years old and he is a young army lieutenant stationed in Alabama. Before long, the \"ungettable\" Zelda has fallen for him despite his unsuitability: Scott isn't wealthy or prominent or even a Southerner, and keeps insisting, absurdly, that his writing will bring him both fortune and fame. Her father is deeply unimpressed. But after Scott sells his first novel, This Side of Paradise, to Scribner's, Zelda optimistically boards a train north, to marry him in the vestry of St. Patrick's Cathedral and take the rest as it comes. What comes, here at the dawn of the Jazz Age, is unimagined attention and success and celebrity that will make Scott and Zelda legends in their own time. Everyone wants to meet the dashing young author of the scandalous novel—and his witty, perhaps even more scandalous wife. Zelda bobs her hair, adopts daring new fashions, and revels in this wild new world. Each place they go becomes a playground: New York City, Long Island, Hollywood, Paris, and the French Riviera—where they join the endless party of the glamorous, sometimes doomed Lost Generation that includes Ernest Hemingway, Sara and Gerald Murphy, and Gertrude Stein. Everything seems new and possible. Troubles, at first, seem to fade like morning mist. But not even Jay Gatsby's parties go on forever. Who is Zelda, other than the wife of a famous—sometimes infamous—husband? How can she forge her own identity while fighting her demons and Scott's, too? With brilliant insight and imagination, Therese Anne Fowler brings us Zelda's irresistible story as she herself might have told it.",

Journalism applies to various media, including but not limited to newspapers, magazines, radio, television, and the internet. The word 'journalist' started to become common in the early 18th century to designate a new kind of writer, about a century before 'journalism' made its appearance to describe what those writers produced. Though varying in form from one age and society to another, it gradually distinguished itself from other forms of writing through its focus on the present, its eye-witness perspective, and its reliance on everyday language. The A to Z of Journalism relates how journalism has evolved over the centuries. This is done through a chronology, an introductory essay, a bibliography, and hundreds of cross-referenced dictionary entries on the different styles of journalism, the different types of media, and important writers and editors.",

You've seen the horror that freedom-fighters can unleash. You've seen the devastation that demented terrorists can inflict. But could you combat the new breed of sophisticated terrorists who are intent on absolute power? Could you out-smart educated terrorists who seek retribution in the name of righteousness? Would you ever condone vigilante terrorists who commit the worst of acts for the purest of motives? This novel is about a group of inspired terrorists whose actions not only changed the world, but also distorted it. They made their mark in a way that no dictator or fanatic had ever managed. No think-tank and no government had ever predicted such a scenario. Would you fight for peace? Would you die for freedom? Would you kill for justice?

Each translation problem is carefully contextualized and illustrated with examples drawn from contemporary literature and the media. Using a comparative analysis approach, the authors discuss grammatical, lexical and semantic translation issues, and offer guidance regarding correct and idiomatic usage. A much-needed addition to the field for university-level students of translation and professional translators alike, the A to Z has been designed with a view to •developing and honing skills in translating between Arabic and English •enhancing idiomatic expression in both languages; •raising awareness of problems specific to Arabic-English and English-Arabic translation; •increasing competency by providing appropriate strategies for effective translation. Alphabetic arrangement of the entries ensures ease of use as both a manual and a reference work. As such, the A to Z is eminently suited for both independent and classroom use..",

This is because the Druze teachings remain inaccessible not only to outsiders but also to uninitiated members within the Druze community itself. Furthermore, proselytizing inducing someone to convert to one's own religious faith has been prohibited since the establishment of the sect in the 11th century. In order to resist assimilation by the various empires and colonial powers that sought to dominate them the Byzantines, various Arab dynasties, the Mamluks and Ottomans, the British and French, in addition to the nations that govern them the Druzes disguise and conceal their beliefs. Therefore, not much is known by outsiders about the Druzes. This dictionary provides nearly 1,000 concise and informative cross-referenced A to Z entries on religious, political, and cultural themes, as well as entries on a number of major families and individuals (artists, writers, diplomats, and leaders) who have contributed to the Druze communities. This volume is also complemented with a chronology, an introductory essay, and a bibliography.\"",

As a keen explorer of the mundane material of everyday life, James Joyce ranks high in the canon of modernist writers. He is arguably the most influential writer of the twentieth-century, and may be the most read, studied, and taught of all modern writers.

Trained as a theoretical physicist specializing in the theory of relativity, he was chosen as the founding editor of The Collected papers of Albert Einstein 25 years ago, and is currently Director of the Boston University Center for Einstein Studies. Based on a detailed study of documentary evidence, much of which was newly discovered in the course of his work, Stachel debunks many of the old (and some new) myths about Einstein and offers novel insight into his life and work. Throughout the volume, a new, more human picture of Einstein is offered to replace the plaster saint of popular legend. In particular, a youthful Einstein emerges from the obscurity that previously shrouded his early years, and much new light is shed on the origins of the special and general theories of relativity. Also discussed in some detail are Einstein's troubled relationship with his first wife, his friendships with other physicists such as Eddington, Bose, and Pauli, and his Jewish identity. The essays are grouped thematically into the following areas: * The Human Side * Editing the Einstein Papers * Surveys of Einstein's Work * Special Relativity * General Relativity * Quantum Theory * Einstein and Other Scientists * Book Reviews Because the essays are independent of one another, readers will be able to dip into this collection to satisfy varying interests. It will be of particular interest to historians of 20th century science, working physicists, and students, as well as to the many members of the general reading public who continue to be fascinated by aspects of Einstein's life and work.",

However, things have changed, and they continue changing at a maddening pace. One new technique after another has made it easier, faster, and above all cheaper to produce the material, which has taken on an increasing variety of forms. The A to Z of Animation and Cartoons is an introduction to all aspects of animation history and its development as a technology and industry beyond the familiar cartoons from the Disney and Warner Bros. Studios. This is done through a chronology, an introductory essay, photos, a bibliography, and over 200 cross-referenced dictionary entries on animators, directors, studios, techniques, films, and some of the best-known characters.",

Today, women scientists and mathematicians must continue to defend the quality of their work and demand the respect they deserve in the mathematical and scientific communities.A to Z of Women in Science and Math, Revised Edition profiles 195 women who fought against these stereotypes throughout history and all over the world to forge new discoveries and theories that would eventually change the way we view science. This thoroughly revised book updates the story of each individual to the present day and features 38 new profiles. Among the profiles included are those of chemists, astronomers, geologists, environmental scientists, and a range of other professions and careers. In addition, new photographs have been added, and the bibliography has been updated.

            "description": "Statistics is confusing, even for smart, technically competent people. And many students and professionals find that existing books and web resources don’t give them an intuitive understanding of confusing statistical concepts. That is why this book is needed. Some of the unique qualities of this book are: • Easy to Understand: Uses unique “graphics that teach” such as concept flow diagrams, compare-and-contrast tables, and even cartoons to enhance “rememberability.” • Easy to Use: Alphabetically arranged, like a mini-encyclopedia, for easy lookup on the job, while studying, or during an open-book exam. • Wider Scope: Covers Statistics I and Statistics II and Six Sigma Black Belt, adding such topics as control charts and statistical process control, process capability analysis, and design of experiments. As a result, this book will be useful for business professionals and industrial engineers in addition to students and professionals in the social and physical sciences. In addition, each of the 60+ concepts is covered in one or more articles. The 75 articles in the book are usually 5–7 pages long, ensuring that things are presented in “bite-sized chunks.” The first page of each article typically lists five “Keys to Understanding” which tell the reader everything they need to know on one page. This book also contains an article on “Which Statistical Tool to Use to Solve Some Common Problems”, additional “Which to Use When” articles on Control Charts, Distributions, and Charts/Graphs/Plots, as well as articles explaining how different concepts work together (e.g., how Alpha, p, Critical Value, and Test Statistic interrelate). ANDREW A. JAWLIK received his B.S. in Mathematics and his M.S. in Mathematics and Computer Science from the University of Michigan. He held jobs with IBM in marketing, sales, finance, and information technology, as well as a position as Process Executive. In these jobs, he learned how to communicate difficult technical concepts in easy - to - understand terms. He completed Lean Six Sigma Black Belt coursework at the IASSC - accredited Pyzdek Institute. In order to understand the confusing statistics involved, he wrote explanations in his own words and graphics. Using this material, he passed the certification exam with a perfect score. Those statistical explanations then became the starting point for this book.",
